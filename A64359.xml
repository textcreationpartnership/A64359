            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>Sir, Do you believe that there is a Real Change wrought upon the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Bread and Wine, after they are Conſecrated by the Prieſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Euchariſt, into the Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, Material, Living Body and Blood of Chriſt, which makes up his Real Perſon, to wit, of Body, Soul and Divinity?</p>

               <speaker>Roman Catholick.</speaker>
               <p>Yes <hi>Sir,</hi> I do believe that the Elements are Tranſubſtantiated into the very living perſon of Chriſt, to wit, of Body, Soul and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; that is, into the very ſame Body which he aſſumed before he died; the ſame Body in which he ſuffered and died upon the Croſs, without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> the ſame Body that laid in the Grave three days; and the very ſame Body in which he aſcended up into Glory, and is ſat down at the right hand of God in Glory.</p>

               <p>Sir, is this all that you have to ſay to prove this Doctrine of your Infallible Church.</p>

               <p>Why then, I pray Sir, Give me leave to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer you as well as I can from Scripture, and from Reaſon alſo.</p>

               <p>Why firſt of all, Sir, in the firſt place give me leave to tell ye, you have not taken the whole verſes or ſentence in ſome of theſe Scriptures which you have quoted; you have gone away with part of a Text, even ſo far as will ſerve your turn, which is a very dangerous thing, for it is no leſs than to clip the King of Heavens Coyn, which is Spiritual High Treaſon, which is the worſt of Treaſon, and is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable with no leſs than all the Curſes of the Book of the Holy Word of God, without true Repentance, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18, 19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.6.</p>
               <p>Sir, you know Satan when he tempted our Bleſſed Saviour Chriſt, he quoted part of a Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſerve his own turn, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.5, 6. <hi>Then the Devil taketh him up into the holy City, and ſetteth him on a pinacle of the Temple, and ſaith unto him, If thou be the Son of God caſt thy ſelf down, for it is written, He ſhall give his Angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they ſhall bear thee up leſt at any time thou daſh thy foot againſt a stone. 'Tis written,</hi> ſaith Satan, quoting <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11, 12. <hi>for he ſhall give his Angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways; they ſhall bear thee up in their hands, leſt thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone:</hi> The Devil leaves out that part of the Text, (to wit) <hi>He ſhall keep thee in all thy ways.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, you do own and believe theſe Scriptures which you have quoted to be underſtood literally and properly, and not Myſtically and Spiritually, but according to the plain letter of them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rom.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, Sir, I do, for the Text is plain and clear.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Now, Sir, I will anſwer you from the words of our Saviour Chriſt in the ſame Chapters, and in ſome of the ſame verſes which you have quoted, and alſo from the words of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in that ſame Chapter which you have made uſe of, and alſo in many other places of the Holy Scriptures, whereby you ſhall ſee by God's aſſiſtance this Doctrine of yours overthrown and utterly confuted; therefore let us bring it to the Touchſtone of Gods Word; <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them,</hi> Iſa. 8.20.</p>

Firſt of all, By the words of our Bleſſed and only Mediator and Redeemer, in <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.19, 20. <hi>And he took Bread and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave it unto them, ſaying, This is my Body which is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for you:</hi> ſo far you go; but you leave out and omit; <hi>this do in Remembrance of me;</hi> likewiſe alſo the Cup after Supper, ſaying, <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood which is ſhed for you.</hi> Mat. 26.26, 27. <hi>And as they were cating, Jeſus took Bread and bleſſed it, and brake it, and gave it to the Diſciples, and ſaid, Take; Eat, this is my Body; and he took the Cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, ſaying, Drink ye all of it.</hi> Here, pray Sir, obſerve by the way, that it is ſaid, that Chriſt took Bread and bleſſed <hi>it,</hi> and <hi>brake it,</hi> and <hi>gave it</hi> to the Diſciples; what is to be underſtood by this word <hi>[it]?</hi> why it was <hi>it</hi> Bread; for had it been Chriſt's Real, Corporeal, Subſtantial Body, it ſhould have been more properer thus, <hi>He took</hi> the Bread and bleſſed him, and brake him, and gave him to the <hi>Diſciples. And he took the Cup and gave Thanks, and gave it to them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Drink ye all of it.</hi> Now if your Doctrine were true, then it ſhould have been, After Chriſt had given Thanks, he gave him to them, ſaying, Drink ye all of him, and not drink ye all of it, that is, all the Congregation, both Miniſter and People that are Chriſt's true Diſciples, muſt all partake of the Cup, or Wine in the Sacrament of the Lords-Supper. But by what Authority your Prieſts are ſo unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table as to deny the Lay-people the Cup, I know not, when as our Saviour Chriſt commands expreſly, that all his Diſciples muſt drink of it, that is of the Wine in the Cup, and not of his Material Blood that was then running in his Humane veins; and the Cup may rather be taken for the Blood of Chriſt than the Wine, if it be to be underſtood literally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Cup only is mentioned, and not the Wine, for it is ſaid, <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood which is ſhed for you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt himſelf did partake of this Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance at the ſame time when he did inſtitute it, <hi>The ſame night in which he was betrayed.</hi> But now if your Doctrine be true, then Chriſt did eat his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Body, and drink his own Material Blood; and yet was viſible with his Diſciples before their Eyes, without any alteration in the leaſt. It is ſaid, <hi>His Blood is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> And
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106854:3"/>yet then at that time Chriſt had not actually and properly ſhed his Blood, but virtually in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God he had done it before the foundation of the world; for all thoſe that ever were ſaved before Chriſt came in the fleſh, and for all that ever ſhould be ſaved after he came in the fleſh, down throughout all Ages to the end of the world, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifeſted in theſe laſt times for you.</hi> Revel. 13.8. <hi>And all that dwell upon the earth ſhall worſhip him whoſe names are not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world.</hi> Act. 2.23. <hi>Him being delivered by the determinate coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and foreknowledg of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have Crucified and ſlain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Ordinance of the Lords-Supper is to be kept up and practiſed in the Churches of God, for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Chriſt's Death and Paſſion, from them words of our Saviour, which words you omit and leave out, namely, <hi>Do this in Remembrance of me,</hi> as will yet further appear by and by from the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words when he celebrated this Holy Ordinance of the Lords-Supper in the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But again, from our Saviour's words which you do take and interpret as if ſpoken literally, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you lay ſo much ſtreſs, and make it ſerve for a foundation to build this Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> upon, which was ſpoken before the Ordinance of the Lords-Supper was Inſtituted by our Saviour himſelf in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.51, 53, 54. <hi>I am the living Bread which came down from Heaven; if any man eat of this Bread he ſhall live for ever. And the Bread that I will give is my fleſh, which I will give for the life of the world. Then Jeſus ſaid unto them, Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, Except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Whoſo eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, hath Eternal life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> Here you ſee it is, <hi>Whoſo eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, &amp;c.</hi> How ſo? what is the meaning of that word of our Saviour Chriſt, viz. <hi>Whoſo eateth, &amp;c?</hi> why this refers to what Chriſt had been ſpeaking before in the ſame Chapter, which leads to this Diſcourſe of <hi>Eating his fleſh, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his blood,</hi> in ſetting out the uſefulneſs and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Grace of Faith, and the abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 35, 40, 47, 48. here you ſhall ſee that this, <hi>Whoſo eateth Chriſts fleſh, and drinketh his blood,</hi> is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Whoſoever believeth in Chriſt, and reſteth upon him alone for Spiritual life here, and Eternal life in Glory hereafter. Pray mark the words of our Saviour, <hi>And Jeſus ſaid unto them, I am the bread of life, he that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me ſhall never thirſt: And this is the will of him that ſent me, that every one which ſeeth the Son and believeth on him, may have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.

               <p>Again, Our Saviour Chriſt has but one humane body, and that is a finite body, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. <hi>For we have not an high prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities: but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without ſin.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour's Body was not to ſee corruption, becauſe it never did ſee ſin, ſo as to be tainted in the leaſt meaſure with it; and therefore Chriſt could never have died, had it not been for the ſins of his people; becauſe the wages of ſin is death. And if Chriſt will take Believers ſins upon him, he muſt take the wages alſo that was due unto them: And therefore it is ſaid, that <hi>he taſted death for every man;</hi> that is, for every man that ever did, or that ever ſhould believe in him: But becauſe his ſin was by imputation, and not inherent in his nature, as ours is, but only by imputation; therefore tho he taſted death for every man, and by that took the curſe or ſting that is in death, away, for all Believers, yet his holy Body did not ſee corruption; Death could not hold him, becauſe there was no ſin in him; but it was upon him by imputation; as Sinners are made righteous, even ſo Chriſt was made a ſinner; for as Sinners are made righteous by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed unto them, ſo Chriſt was made a Sinner by imputing our ſins unto him; but not by Contamination or Pollution, but as a Surety; for if Chriſt had had no more ſin upon him, than he had in him, he could never have died; it had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; for it would have been inconſiſtent with the Juſtice of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5, 6, 10. <hi>But he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed. All we like ſheep have gone aſtray, we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all; yet it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief; when thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin.</hi> But this of our Saviour Chriſt's giving his fleſh to eat, and his blood to drink, muſt be underſtood Symbolically and Sacramentally by Faith, it is the ſign of Chriſt's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:106854:4"/>had not Chriſt taken humane fleſh upon him, and died for ſinners, the whole ſpecies of the humane race had periſhed and been loſt as all the fallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were, and not one ſoul had ever been ſaved; and ſo his fleſh and blood became meat and drink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, to live upon him by faith alone, who do ſhare in all theſe benefits and bleſſings which came by Chriſt's taking fleſh and blood upon him; and is not ſuch a wonderful great mercy as this is, worthy of a holy thankful remembrance? which is the principal end and deſign of Chriſt in his Inſtituting of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and ought to be ours in partaking of it; for if our Saviour Chriſt had given us his material fleſh to eat, and his real blood to drink, it would have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed us nothing. And thus are the words of our Saviour to be underſtood in that 6. <hi>Joh.</hi> in retort to the carnal conception of the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> as well as to his unbelieving Diſciples which drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med even as you do of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick faith, that Chriſt ſpake of giving them his real ſubſtantial body to eat, and his real blood to drink; ſaid the <hi>Jews, How can this man give us his fleſh to eat?</hi> and ſaid the Diſciples, <hi>This is an hard ſaying, who can bear it?</hi> But mind narrowly our Saviour's own words, <hi>viz. It is the ſpirit that quickeneth, the fleſh profiteth nothing; the words that I ſpeak unto you, they are ſpirit, and they are life.</hi> It is the Spirit that begetteth faith in every true Believer; and that quickeneth the new Creature or Babe of Grace, after it is begotten and born of God in its firſt quicknings or formation, and in its after-quicknings, for it is of the ſeed Royal of Heaven, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.29. and it is conveyed unto us through Jeſus Chriſt by his holy Spirit, and ſo we come to be made alive to God, and are Children of the moſt High, for God is the Father of Spirits, and the only Spiritual Father of all that believe in Jeſus Chriſt, his only Son from all Eternity by Generation, for all the reſt of Gods Sons of humane race are his Sons by Adoption and Regeneration; and all this is effected and brought about through the agency and aid of the Holy and ever Bleſſed and Eternal Spirit; and therefore that which is thus begotten and born of God, muſt be Spiritual; for as <hi>Adam</hi> begot a Son in his own likeneſs, who was himſelf of the Earth, and Earthly; ſo God begets all his Children in his own likeneſs, who are all Spiritual and Heavenly Children; they have all of them the Image of their Father ſtamped upon them, which is Grace and Holineſs; the more holy, the more like unto God they are, who is Eſſentially holy; and theefore the food which this ſpiritual man liveth upon, muſt be Spiritual, Heavenly food; he lives upon God in Chriſt, and feeds upon God in Chriſt by faith; for all our ſprings are in him. Now for any perſons to imagin that a ſpiritual being can live and ſubſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on carnal material food, is but a vain imagination; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

And ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe our Saviour gives the like interpretation of the graces of the Spirit in the Believer, much after the ſame manner; which are compared to rivers of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving water in <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.37, 38, 39. <hi>In the laſt day, that great day of the Feaſt, Jeſus ſtood and cried, ſaying, if any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink.</hi> And pray mind what the drink is that Chriſt giveth him, <hi>He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water.</hi> But pray mind what Expoſition our Bleſſed Redeemer gives in the following verſes, <hi>But this ſpake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him ſhould receive.</hi> You ſee this drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king here is by faith in Chriſt, and the liquor which they drink, is ſpiritual liquor, it is the water of life.</p>
               <p>Now if theſe Scriptures are to be underſtood li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally and properly, then you muſt underſtand the Contexts, and the Coherence of them literally and properly alſo; for Chriſt does not, as I remember, ſpeak a whole ſentence, wherein one part wholly contains ſpiritual matter, and the other part wholly contains a literal and proper meaning in it; tho one whole ſentence may have both a myſtical and literal meaning in it: Now pray mind in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.35, 50. <hi>And Jeſus ſaid unto them, I am the bread of life; he that cometh to me, ſhall never hunger; and he that believeth in me, ſhall never thirſt.</hi> Now is not here the very ſame reaſon to believe that we ſhall never be corporally a hungry, nor a thirſt again, as there is for us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that that is material bread or fleſh that Chriſt ſpake of in the ſame verſe? <hi>Again this is the bread which cometh down from Heaven, that a man may eat thereof and not die.</hi> Now is not here as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe and underſtand this literally and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, as there is for any of the other to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſo? and if the reſt be to be underſtood ſo, then they that eat Chriſt's fleſh, and drink his blood, ſhall never die a natural death.</p>
               <p>Again, if this Doctrine in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. be to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood literally and properly, then muſt the Doctrine of Regeneration be underſtood ſo, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. And if ſo, then none ſhould ever ſee the Kingdom of God, nor enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, and be ſaved, but them, and them only that crept into their mothers womb, and were born again, literally and properly, as old <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ignorantly imagined. There is every whit as much reaſon to believe this, as there is to believe your Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> Pray mind the Interrogation of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> how like they are the one to the other: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                  <hi>is old, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, the <hi>Jews</hi> they ſaid, <hi>How can this man give us his fleſh to eat?</hi> Now if theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. and in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. are to be taken, and the ſenſe of them expounded literally in the plain letter of the word, then muſt this of <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.38. be underſtood ſo in like manner, where it is ſaid that rivers of living water ſhall flow out of the Believers belly; and we might as rationally expect that Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers ſhould ply the Ferry at every believers belly in theſe rivers of living water; and alſo that every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever has crept into his mothers womb, and been born again, as to believe that the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament of the Lords-Supper after Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Tranſubſtantiated into the Body, Soul, and Divinity of our Saviour Chriſt, which is into his very perſon. But what will become of all thoſe poor ſouls whoſe mothers are dead before they are or were converted, that have never a mothers womb to creep into? for I will aſſure you that the one is as true as the other, let who will deny or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it. And thus you do hear how our Saviour Chriſt hath expounded his own meaning, who ſpake as never man ſpake like him, he has given a clear interpretation of theſe myſtical Scriptures afore mentioned, that this eating of his fleſh, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his blood, is to be underſtood Symbolically, Spiritually, and Sacramentally, by faith, to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate the great love of God in the Tranſaction of mans Redemption by the Death and Sufferings of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. But thus much for the words of our Saviour Chriſt for the preſent.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, in the ſecond place, let us hear the full of what the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith unto this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine alſo, for give me leave to tell ye, Sir, that you have quoted but part of the Apoſtle's words, you have curtailed his words alſo in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23, 25, 26. <hi>For I have received of the Lord that which alſo I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver unto you, that the Lord Jeſus the ſame night in which he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thanks he brake it, and ſaid, Take this my body.</hi> Thus far you go, <hi>Take, Eat this my body;</hi> what Body was that? why it was Chriſt's Sacramental Body, namely the Bread and Wine, which are the Signs of his Body, which prefigures out unto us his real ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Body, which was Crucified without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> it is to Commemorate the Death and Sufferings of Chriſt, and all the Benefits and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which did flow forth unto poor loſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done fallen man, for all that ever did believe, or that ever ſhould believe in him, and expect eternal life and ſalvation upon the account of his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Merits alone, through the aid and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of the Eternal bleſſed and holy Spirit, and all this comes flowing unto us from that Bleſſed foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all the Chriſtians Mercies, namely the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal love of God the Father, which was the efficient or firſt moving cauſe of all. And as the Glorious Trinity had all a hand in making man, ſo they all have a hand in redeeming man.</p>
               <p>But again, this is that Body which was evidently ſet forth Crucified before the <hi>Galatians</hi> eyes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. It was the Repreſentation of Chriſt's Crucified Body in the Sacrament of the Lords-Supper among the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and not the Real Crucifixion of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Body without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And this is that Body which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Take, Eat, this my body,</hi> that was his Sacramental body, or the ſign of his body. In the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, that was crucified and nothing elſe; and this is that body which all true believers in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament do diſcern and partake of, and eat now in the Churches of Chriſt, and all this is done by faith in a holy Reverential Remembrance of Chriſt, to ſhew forth his Death till he come.</p>

                  <hi>After the ſame manner alſo he took the Cup when he had ſupped, ſaying, This Cup is the New Teſtament in my blood, this do ye, as often as ye drink it, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance:</hi> Which latter words you always omit, and take no notice at all of them; which words carry great weight in them, if you would but be ſo kind unto your own ſouls as to adhere unto them; for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>As often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew the Lords Death till he come.</hi> This Ordinance was Inſtituted by our Saviour Chriſt himſelf, the ſame night in which he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed.

Or Secondly, They fetch down Chriſt materially, perſonally, from the right hand of God the Father: And if ſo, then in the third place, Chriſt has no time at all in Heaven with the Father, (I call it time in Heaven, for diſtinction ſake) to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede and plead as an Advocate and Mediator with God the Father for ſinners, all his time would be taken up and ſpent in attending upon the Prieſts every time they ſay Maſs, in all thoſe many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote places round the Globe almoſt, which takes in their Maſs-hours, perhaps, all the four and twenty Hours, being upon ſeveral Horrizons. Fourthly, If this Doctrine be true, then Chriſt is come, and then this Ordinance ceaſes to be, as I conceive, and there needs no ſuch thing to remember him by, or to ſhew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:106854:6"/>ſwade him to ſtay when he is come in your Maſs; for according to your Doctrine, there is a compleat Chriſt that cometh in the Maſs, every time it is ſaid; for when Chriſt doth come from the right hand of God to judg the quick and the dead, as you your ſelves do confeſs, and own in your own Creed, to my own certain knowledg; which I ſhall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeak more of by and by; for Chriſt will come then in no other manner, as to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, than in Body, Soul and Divinity; if he went to Heaven ſo, he will come again ſo; as you may ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Ye men of Galilee, why ſtand ye gazing up into Heaven? this ſame Jeſus which is taken up from you into Heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner as ye have ſeen him go into Heaven.</hi> Now if Chriſt be thus come, then I humbly conceive, this Ordinance ſhould be at an end; for when once the ſubſtance is come, then the ſhadows muſt flee away and ceaſe to be; for <hi>what need the children of the Bride-chamber mourn when the Bridegroom ſhall come again to them,</hi> and be with them for ever? for what need a man have any thing to put him in mind, or to remember a friend that is always preſent with him, and is always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes?—Why when Chriſt doth come, his <hi>people ſhall ſee him eye to eye,</hi> Iſa. 52.8. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Behold he cometh in the Clouds, and every eye ſhall ſee him. And they alſo which pierced him,</hi> that ſhall be both Jews and Gentiles, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10.</p>
               <p>Again thirdly, the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt was to be offered up but once;</hi> and he gives this as one reaſon of it, <hi>viz.</hi> for ſaith he, <hi>If he had been offered up often, then muſt he have ſuffered often ſince the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> whom ſome do count Prince of the Apoſtles, ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt ſuffered once,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.18. <hi>For Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for ſin, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in the fleſh, but quickened by the ſpirit.</hi> Mark ye, it was the humane fleſh or body of Chriſt that ſuffered and died, and not his Godhead, for that is not capable of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—I pray, Sir, obſerve theſe following Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and believe them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.25, 26, 28. <hi>For Chriſt is not entered into the holy place made without hands, which are the forerunners of the true; but into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us; nor yet that he ſhould offer himſelf often, as the high Prieſts entered into the holy place every year, with the blood of others; for then muſt he often have ſuffered ſince the foundation of the world: But now in the end of the world hath appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf: So Chriſt was once offered to bear the ſin of many; and unto them that look for him, ſhall he appear the ſecond time without ſin unto Salvation.</hi> Here you ſee Chriſt was ordained and appointed to be offered up but once, and that was a ſufficient ſacrifice for ſin, in the wiſdom and account of God: but you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Why, It is the Man of ſin, Antichriſt: His very Titles, as well as his Characters and Practiſes ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſame. It is he that is gotten into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and claims a power and ſoveraignty over Kings and Rulers, and over Mens ſouls and Conſciences: But he is but a Uſurper, for he exalts himſelf unto that Power and Dominion; for it is a power that properly and peculiarly belongeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jeſus Chriſt, for it is he that is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and the only Ruler of Princes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.15. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.15, 16. <hi>By me Kings reign, and Princes decree juſtice; by one Princes Rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the earth.</hi> Here you ſee, whoſe right it is to Rule over Kings, and Princes, and Judges of the Earth; Ay, and Chriſt is to have this power reſtored unto him again, becauſe God the Father hath promiſed it unto him: And alſo it is his right, in <hi>Ezck.</hi> 21.27. <hi>I will overturn, overturn, overturn it, and it ſhall be no more, until he come whoſe right it is, and I will give it him.</hi> Rev. 17.16, 17. <hi>And the ten horns which thou ſaweſt upon the beaſt, theſe ſhall hate the whore, and ſhall make her deſolate and naked, and ſhall cather fleſh, and burn her with fire; for God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will.</hi> I am apt to think that this is Antichriſt's will which they fulfil, and to agree and give their Kingdom to the Beaſt, until the Word of God ſhall be fulfilled, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.25. <hi>He ſhall ſtand up againſt the Prince of Princes; but he ſhall be broken without hands,</hi> Iſa. 47.8, 9, 10, 11. Rev. 18.7, 8. And that which is to antecede, or go before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Antichriſt to uſher it in upon him, you have in <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.17, 18, 19, 20, 21.

But you will ask me, who this Antichriſt, the Man of ſin, is? why, my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in the genral is this, That the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> has deſcribed him, and ſet ſeveral infallible marks upon him, that he may eaſily be diſtinguiſhed from all other perſons in the World; he is the head of the many Antichriſts which did Apoſtatize from the true Goſpel, Worſhip, Doctrine and Diſcipline; he is the chief head and promoter of all wickedneſs, and therefore called, the <hi>Man of ſin,</hi> by way of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, as you may ſee in that famous deſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Chapter, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.2, 3, 4. Here the Apoſtle brings it in by way of caution to the Chriſtians of that day, and in the ſpirit of Propheſie alſo, <hi>viz. that ye be not ſoon ſhaken in mind, or troubled neither by Spirit, nor by Word, nor by Letter, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Chriſt is at hand;</hi> Pray hath had his day; for as Antichriſt hath ſat upon Chriſt's Throne, <hi>viz.</hi> the Temple of God, and made his people his footſtool, which is indeed to make Chriſt his footſtool; for what is done to his people is done to himſelf: As you may ſee in the Caſe of this Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was a Perſecutor, Acts 9. <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me? Who art thou, Lord? I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt.</hi> Why, ſo Chriſt will depoſe the man of ſin, and take the Throne himſelf, and make Antichriſt his footſtool; for if Antichriſt will exalt himſelf above all that is called God, and ſit in the ſeat of God himſelf, then he muſt be abaſed and made Chriſt's footſtool: For the Word of God ſaith, <hi>He that exalteth himſelf ſhall be abaſed:</hi> And therefore Antichriſt muſt be made Chriſt's footſtool; for Chriſt in his day of Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will debaſe this Uſurper, and tread him under his feet. But to return to what I was upon, let no man deceive you by any means, for that ſhall not come, except there come a falling away firſt, and that Man of ſin be revealed, the Son of Perdition. The Apoſtle gives him the ſame Name or Title here, as our Saviour has given <hi>Judas,</hi> who betraied him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.12. And the Apoſtle has a great deal of reaſon for giving Antichriſt this Title; for as <hi>Judas,</hi> under the pretence of the greateſt friendſhip, proved our Saviour's greateſt enemy; why, ſo does Antichriſt; and as <hi>Judas</hi> had a hand in crucifying Chriſt's real Body, ſo hath Antichriſt in crucifying of Chriſt's myſtical Body, the Catholick, Apoſtolical Church. Pray mind how the Apoſtle has laid down the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, wherein he gives the infallible Marks and Characters of Antichriſt, Firſt, there was to be a falling away, that is, the Apoſtatizing from the true Doctrine of Faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2. Secondly, <hi>The man of ſin muſt be revealed;</hi> That is, he muſt appear viſible in the Church, or Temple of God, in his Colours. Thirdly, here is his practices when he is thus revealed, <hi>viz.</hi> he oppoſeth and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God, or that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped; That is, above all the Civil Magiſtracy, and above all the Miniſtry, both which Orders of Men are called Gods in Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.34, 35. and there is a Civil Worſhip or Reverence that is due unto them both, above all other men. But this is not all, but he exalts himſelf above God himſelf, and placeth himſelf in the room of Chriſt, ſo that he, as God, ſitteth in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God; and he oppoſeth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth all power that ſtandeth in the way of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting himſelf, both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil; and he exalted himſelf, by taking to himſelf that power which belongeth only to God, <hi>viz.</hi> the Soveraignty over all Kings, Princes and Rulers, which either his Sword or Deceit can Conquer, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.25. <hi>And through his policy alſo he ſhall cauſe craft to proſper in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106854:7"/>and by peace ſhall deſtroy many:</hi> That is, thoſe which adhere unto his Doctrine, and are reconciled unto him as their Head, and ſo are at peace with him; by which peace their Souls will be deſtroyed, for it is a peace with Satan; and therefore judge what kind of fruit that peace muſt produce. Laſtly, He Exalts himſelf above all true Worſhip and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, which is above all Churches, and over mens Souls and Conſciences, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.13. And he aſſumes to himſelf one of God's Glorious Attributes, namely his Holineſs; for none is eſſentially Holy, nor Holineſs, but God: So that he, as God, ſitteth in the Temple of God; That is, where none but Chriſt ought to ſit: And this is his ſtanding up <hi>againſt the Prince of Princes; but he ſhall be broken without hands,</hi> ſaith <hi>Daniel</hi> 8.25. <hi>He ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the brightneſs of Chriſt's coming,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.8. <hi>Therefore evil ſhall come upon thee, thou ſhalt not know from whence it cometh; and miſchief ſhall fall upon him, he ſhall not be able to put it off: and it ſhall come ſuddenly,</hi> ſaith the Propher, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47. <hi>When God begins, he will ſoon make an end: and her plagues ſhall come in one day,</hi> ſaith <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 18. that may be in one year which is at hand, I doubt not.</p>

And thus you ſee clearly, that they condemn themſelves of being guilty of the Blood of the Martyrs, by their own Argument, which they vainly uſe to clear themſelves from being Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Again, Thirdly, If a bare verbal Confeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt being come in the fleſh, be ſufficient to intereſt them in the great privilege of true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, then may the Devils themſelves come in for a ſhare of this kind of Chriſtianity, and great Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege; for they went a great way beyond this, of a bare Confeſſion that Jeſus Chriſt was come in the Fleſh; for they owned, and confeſſed him to be the Son of God, and worſhipped him, as Chriſt told the Devil, when he tempted him, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.28. <hi>When he ſaw Jeſus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice, ſaid, What have I to do with thee, Jeſus thou Son of God, moſt high? I beſeech thee torment me not.</hi> Luke 4.41. <hi>And Devils alſo came out of many, crying out, and ſaying, Thou art Chriſt the Son of God; and he rebuking them, ſuffered them not to ſpeak, for they knew that he was Chriſt.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> 2.19. <hi>Thou believeſt that there is one God, thou doſt well: the Devils alſo believe and tremble.</hi> Alas, it is not a notional confeſſion of the Head only, of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in the Fleſh, in words only, that will make a Man a true Chriſtian, and intitle him unto all thoſe glorious privileges which does ariſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from; for people may confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the Fleſh, in words, and yet at the ſame time deny it in works, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.16. <hi>They profeſs that they know God, but in works they deny him, being abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and diſobedient, and unto every good work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate.</hi> 2 Pet. 2.1. <hi>But there were falſe Prophets among the people, even as there ſhall be falſe teachers among you, who privily ſhall bring in damnable hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bringing upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction.</hi> Jud. 4. <hi>For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation; ungodly men, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grace of God into laſciviouſneſs: denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This is a deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jeſus Chriſt to be come in the fleſh Doctrinally.</p>
               <p>Again, This Man of Sin is one that pretends to the Apoſtolical Office, and working of Miracles and Wonders, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Even him whoſe coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and ſigns, and lying wonders:</hi> Who is this <hi>him</hi> that cometh?

                  <hi>if he that cometh,</hi> Who is this he that cometh? Why, it is even the ſame again with him that cometh, <hi>viz.</hi> The Man of Sin, the Antichriſt. And what does he do after he cometh? Pray mark: <hi>For if he that cometh, preacheth another Jeſus whom we have not preached, and if ye receive another Spirit which ye have not received, or another Goſpel which ye have not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, ye might well bear with him.</hi> Here the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Propheſied of another Jeſus, that is, of a falſe tranſubſtantiated Chriſt, as I humbly conceive, which he ſaw by the inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, would come into the Goſpel Church or Temple of God, which cauſed God to turn it into a Deſart: And theſe are the ſame falſe Chriſts which our Saviour does forewarn us, and commands us not to go out after them; That is, that we ſhould not believe in them. <hi>Matt.</hi> 24.23, 24, 25, 26. And there was Signs and Wonders to attend theſe falſe Chriſts which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſpake of; inſomuch, that if it were poſſible, they ſhould deceive the very Elect: But they are but lying Wonders, and falſe Signs, as the Apoſtle declares, they are made up of deceit. But here the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of another Spirit, which St. <hi>John</hi> calleth <hi>the ſpirit of Antichriſt,</hi> 1 John 4.3. Rev. 16.13, 14. This is the ſame ſpirit by which they do work their pretended Miracles, Signs and Lying Wonders; and this is another Goſpel, which is, their Canons and Councils, Decrees and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, and unſcriptural Traditions of old Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and ſo they did caſt off the true and pure Goſpel of God, and do not adhere unto it to this day; and place theſe Scriptures of their own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the room of it, and cry them up to be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical, and Infallible: And this is that, another Goſpel, namely, A falſe Antichriſtian Goſpel, ſtuffed with nothing but Errors and Hereſie. And pray obſerve what the Apoſtle ſaith, by way of caution, concerning this kind of Goſpel, and them that Teach it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9. <hi>But tho we, or an Angel from heaven preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accurſed. As we ſaid before, ſo ſay I now again, if any man preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that ye have received, let him be accurſed.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpake by the inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically and clearly of what was to come into the Temple of God, when the Man of Sin ſhould be revealed. And in the 13, 14, 15. verſes of that 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. he gives a clear character of thoſe perſons that ſhould be guilty in aſſiſting to bring in and preach up another Jeſus, and another Spirit, and another Goſpel, into the Temple of God, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch are falſe Apoſtles, deceitful workers, transforming themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt; and no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, for Satan himſelf is transformed into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light, therefore it is no great thing if his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And here the Apoſtle layeth down their forbidding to marry, and commanding to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from Meats, to be part of theſe Lies; <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Speaking lies in hypocriſie, having their conſcience ſeared with a hot Iron, forbidding to marry, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding to abſtain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thankſgiving of them which believe, and know the Truth.</hi> (Mark) they pervert the very End and Deſign of God in the Creation of theſe things; God has created them to be made uſe of in his own way and ordinance, the one in Chaſtity, and the other in Temperance. Not but that a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or any others are left to their liberty, whether they will marry or not; but they ought not to be impoſed on by others; but in this caſe they are a law to themſelves; neither doth this deſtroy a holy faſting or abſtinency, when it is done heartily and ſincerely, according to God's own appointment and preſcription in his Holy Word; but it wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys all Impoſitions that are irregular; and alſo it deſtroys all Phariſaical, Hypocritical Meritorious Faſting and Penance.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, How can this forbidding to marry, and commanding to abſtain from Meats, be part of thoſe Lies and Doctrines of Devils which they ſpeak in Hypocriſie?</p>
               <p>Firſt, in forbidding to marry, they injoyn the penalty of Damnation; and pretend that if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Spiritual Orders do marry, they do not only forfeit the ſaid Office, but do alſo incur the guilt of damnation, and they will yet ſooner abſolve them of the guilt of Fornication or Adultery, as they pretend, than of that offence. Now this is Diametrically contrary to the Holy Scriptures, which is the whole Faith and Truth, which they are departed from; and therefore, it muſt needs be a lie, for the word of Truth ſaith plainly, <hi>That it is better to marry than to burn,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.9.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They do command all to abſtain from Meats, and make the ignorant people believe that they ſhall be damned if they eat fleſh on certain times and ſeaſons which they have prohibited, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a diſpenſation from the Church, which is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

But the Man of Sin is a lier, and is departed from the Faith, and the Truth is not in him. Thus you ſee how they do impoſe upon the eaſie credulous ignorant people, and make them believe that if they do diſobey the Canons or Commands of their Church, they do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the penalty of damnation; becauſe ſay they, our Church is infallible, and cannot err.

Why even ſo Antichriſt by force or fraud makes them an ignorant willing people in the day of his Dragooning power, by the permiſſion of God. But here lieth the great difference; whereas God when he doth come by his Spirit, by the Omnipotent power of Grace to work upon the ſouls of ſinners to make them a willing people, he alſo maketh them a wiſe and underſtanding people, <hi>Pſal</hi> 119.130. <hi>The entrance of thy words giveth light, it giveth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to the ſimple.</hi> God worketh firſt upon the Underſtanding, and then upon the Will, and by that he enlightens the Mind in the knowledg of Chriſt, and then the Will is ſanctified and changed, and ſo of an unwilling people they are made will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But Antichriſt when he exerts and puts forth his power to proſelyte a ſoul, he works firſt upon the Underſtanding, and then upon the Will alſo; but it is to put out the common light of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in Spiritual things, and wholly depraveth the Will, and reſigns it up to the will of Antichriſt, and then leadeth the Mind wholly into the dark, that they may not diſcern their deceit, nor ſee the true way to come to the knowledg of Chriſt; and therefore they take away and rob them of the Key of Knowledg, namely the Holy Scriptures, which is the Rule of Life and Faith, that every man ought to walk by and believe, becauſe it is the revealed Will of God.</p>
               <p>But ſay they, our Church is infallible, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err; that is, ſhe is ſo good and ſo holy, that there needs no amendment nor reformation in her; which if it were true, would be a higher degree of perfection than ever any Church of Chriſt has yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

               <p>And now to clench this Nail that is driven into the head of Antichriſt the Man of Sin, pray look into the ſame Chapter where he is deſcribed and propheſied of, and obſerve ſtrictly what is the cauſe that produced this dreadful effect, namely what was it that provoked God to bring this tremendous judgment upon them; and there you ſhall find that it is charged upon them by way of prediction for their deſpiſing and departing from the Faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. which is from the whole Doctrine of Faith, namely the Goſpel of God, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Even him whoſe coming is after the working of Satan, with all power and ſigns, and lying wonders, and with all deceiveableneſs of unrighteouſneſs in them that periſh, becauſe they receive not the love of the truth that they might be ſaved. And for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions that they ſhould believe a lie, that they all might be damned who believe not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> They pleaſe themſelves with the conceit of being ſaved by their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which is unrighteouſneſs in competition with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt for Juſtification; they departed from the very Doctrine of Faith, the means of Grace and Salvation, which is the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al food under Chriſt for the ſouls of true Chriſtian Believers to live upon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.8, 9, 10.—Now that perſon muſt needs periſh and die that refuſeth and deſpiſeth his natural food, and will not feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, but pretend to live upon the wind; why even ſo it is with a reſpect to Spiritual food, that ſoul or ſouls muſt needs periſh and be damned, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and refuſe the means of Grace and Salvation: <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>they received not the love of the truth that they might be ſaved; and for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions that they ſhould believe a lie, that they all might be damned.</hi> That is, the whole of their Faith, Doctrine, Diſcipline and Worſhip, is one great lie; as the whole of the true Goſpel-Faith, Doctrine, Diſcipline, and Worſhip, is called the Truth in the ſame Chapter, in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this great Lie. So that the whole of their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual opinion is only a heap of lies and deceit wrapt up and incorporated together; And therefore called by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>a ſtrong deluſion, and a lie.</hi> It is a Deluſion full of Deluſions, or a Lie full of Lies.

Fourthly, you may obſerve that it was not an ordinary weak puny Judgment or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion that God ſent, which ſhould not be able or ſtrong enough to do the work; no, but it was a ſtrong deluſion that ſhould overcome them. Fifthly, you may obſerve that this ſtrong Deluſion was not then come, becauſe that the Man of Sin was not yet revealed. Sixthly, the cauſe of it was then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing, for the <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity</hi> did then begin to work. Seventhly, hence we may obſerve, that they themſelves did chuſe theſe Deluſions, which was their great ſin, by which they provoked God to give them up unto them; and ſo God in his Juſtice made their ſin their puniſhment; for it is ſaid, <hi>The Backſlider in heart ſhall be filled with his own ways.</hi> Eighthly, we may obſerve, that altho this <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity</hi> did begin to work even then in the Apoſtles day, yet it was not to come to that full meaſure and degree of iniquity which it was to come unto, until after his death, that was not until the Man of Sin ſhould be revealed, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.29, 30. Ninthly and laſtly, it is to be obſerved, that the cauſe of God's ſending this ſtrong deluſion unto them, was for their abandoning and caſting off the Goſpel of God, which tendered Life and Salvation by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs unto them; and following after ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vanities; it was that which provoked God to inflict this ſore judgment upon them, <hi>ſo that they have eyes and ſee not, and ears and hear not;</hi> which may very aptly refer to this, <hi>viz.</hi> that theſe perſons have as great natural Gifts and Endowments as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons have; namely, Sence, Reaſon, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, with all the Intellectuals and Faculties that belong unto men as men; but they are not ſuffered to make uſe of them upon Spiritual objects or occaſions; neither will they ſuffer themſelves to make uſe of them in that way and manner as would moſt glorifie God, and tend to the Salvation of their own ſouls; their Conſciences are ſeared with a hot Iron, they have quite loſt all Spiritual feeling; for tho Sences, Reaſon, Underſtanding, and all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties do their work and office, yet none of them are to be believed: And who are blinder than thoſe that will not ſee?

I have made a tedious digreſſion, by which I have gone a little out of my way, but it was to meet with Antichriſt the Man of Sin, and his Adherents, which are all out in the Wilderneſs with the Woman, or deſerted Church, and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous worſhip which doth belong unto him, and doth attend upon him.

               <p>But now, my Dear Friend, although I have taken a very long turn with Antichriſt, yet I remember my promiſe unto you, <hi>viz.</hi> That I would meet you again upon our old Topic or Point of Doctrine that we were diſcourſing upon, before I met with Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, the Man of Sin, namely the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> for I have not done with that as yet; for I have more conſiderations to offer againſt it, for the confuting of it; the firſt ſhall be this: <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt ſaith, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. <hi>I am he that liveth and was dead; and behold I am alive for evermore.</hi> Pray miſtake not, for as Chriſt was God, ſo he could not die; for his Godhead could not ſuffer, nor die.

Tho Antichriſt have uſurped Chriſt's Throne for a long time, in the Temple of God, and Reigned and Ruled over the Souls and Conſciences of men, which is Chriſt's pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Prerogative, yet <hi>the time is at hand</hi> that he ſhall be made his footſtool; this was ſpoken Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically by <hi>David,</hi> of what was to be in the laſt times, at the period of Antichriſt's Reign, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1.

But whether he will come perſonally, as ſome are of opinion he will, or otherwiſe, I will not determine; but I will leave the Reader to the Scriptures, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9, 10, 11. <hi>And when he had ſpoken theſe things, while they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their ſight. And while they looked ſtedfaſtly toward heaven as he went up, behold two men ſtood by them in white apparel, which alſo ſaid, Ye men of Galilee, why ſtand ye gazing up into heaven? This ſame Jeſus which is taken up from you into heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner as ye have ſeen him go into heaven.</hi> Rev. 20.4. Rev. 1.7. Job 19.25, 26, 27. Now, Does Chriſt ſo come in your Maſs? But now if Chriſt be in perſon, ſitting at the right hand of God the Father, in Glory, as you ſee clearly proved by the Holy Word of God he is, and that he is not to come from thence untill his enemies be made his footſtool; and that when he does come from thence, he is to come in like manner as he aſcended <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

He is entred into Heaven as the forerunner, for his people; he entred into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us as an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate: <hi>He is the firſt fruits of the reſurrection of the dead.</hi> So that this Doctrine of Chriſt's Perſonal and Corporeal Preſence in the Sacrament, does even contradict and deſtroy your own Faith or Creed, as well as it does overthrow the whole current of the Holy and Sacred Scriptures. As for the former, I will appeal, even unto you your own ſelves who are <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> that do ſay, and pretend to own and believe your own Creed, whether it be not ſo or no? And as for the latter, I will appeal unto all ſorts of Chriſtians whatſoever, that do own and believe the Holy Scriptures to be the revealed word and will of God, whether it be not ſo or no? And alſo I will appeal to their own Sence and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>Again ſecondly, Let us hear further what the Apoſtle ſaith, for more light into this dark matter; in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Brethren, I would not that ye ſhould be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all paſſed thorow the ſea: And were all baptized unto Moſes</hi> (who was a type of Chriſt) <hi>And were all baptized unto Moſes in the cloud, and in the ſea: And did all eat the ſame ſpiritual meat: And did all drink the ſame ſpiritual drink: For they drank of that ſpiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Chriſt.</hi> Theſe were all true Believers in Chriſt, which were among the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s days, and all of them did live by Faith upon Chriſt, and they all fed upon the ſame ſpiritual food then, as we do now under the Goſpel, this is that hidden Manna, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. This is that meat which God gives his Children to eat, which the World knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of. By Faith, <hi>Moſes</hi> forſook <hi>Egypt,</hi> not fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wrath of the King; for he endured, as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him who is Inviſible. That was by an eye of Faith, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw Chriſt in his day, that could not be ſeen by an eye of ſenſe; through Faith he kept the Paſſover and ſprinkling of Blood, leſt he that deſtroyed the firſt born, ſhould touch them; by Faith, they paſſed through the Red Sea, as by dry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:106854:11"/>Chriſt under the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, is wholly aſcribed unto Faith; and that it was Spiritual meat and drink, and the very ſame meat and drink that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers do live upon ſpiritually now, under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation of the Goſpel; hence you may obſerve, that Chriſt was as much materially and corporeally eaten and drank, before ever he had aſſumed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, or had a real material body to eat, and blood to drink, as ever he has been at any time ſince, that he hath taken humane nature upon him; for if Chriſt be really Tranſubſtantiated into his very perſon conſiſting of Body, Soul and Divinity, and ſo eaten, now under the Goſpel, ſince he had a Body, why, then it will neceſſarily and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially follow, that Chriſt was corporeally and ſubſtantially eaten in Body, Soul and Divinity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever he had a Body to be eaten; for you ſee it clearly proved from the Apoſtle's words, that the believing <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did eat the ſame ſpiritual meat, and did all drink the ſame ſpiritual drink then, as true Believers do now under the Goſpel; for the Text ſaith plainly, that <hi>they did all eat of the ſame ſpiritual meat, and did all drink of the ſame ſpiritual drink; for they drank of that ſpiritual Rock that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, and that Rock was Chriſt.</hi> The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> might as well have Tranſubſtantiated a Rock into the real Body and Blood of Chriſt, and ſo eaten and dranken that inſtead of Chriſt, or for Chriſt, which is to eat Stones inſtead of the Bread of Life; as for you to imagine, or pretend to eat and drink Chriſt corporeally and perſonally in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt: For I will aſſure ye that there is as good Reaſon, and as clear a Warrant and Authority, either from Scripture or Reaſon, to believe the one, as there is to believe the other; for our Saviour Chriſt was ſpiritual meat and ſpiritual drink under the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, and he is the ſame and no other now under the Goſpel: Their feeding upon Chriſt, and injoying communion and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Chriſt, under the Law, was Spiritual and by Faith; why, even ſo it is the ſame, and no more, nor no leſs now, nor in all foregoing Ages under the Goſpel. Chriſt is to be received and eaten by Faith, and in ſpiritual love alſo now, as he was then, of which I ſhall give you a farther proof by and by.</p>
               <p>Again thirdly, Pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> obſerve ſtrictly what the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20, 21. <hi>But I ſay, the things which the Gentiles ſacrifice, they ſacrifice to Devils, and not to God. I would not that ye ſhould have fellowſhip with Devils: Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of Devils; ye cannot be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Lord's Table, and of the Table of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</hi>

For there never was but one real Propitiatory, and ſufficient Sacrifice for all the ſins of Gods people both under the Law, and under the Goſpel, and that was Chriſt, who was offered up a living Sacrifice, holy and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto God, and that but <hi>once,</hi> as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved from the holy Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11. <hi>For the Law having a ſhadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with thoſe Sacrifices which they offered year by year continually, make the comers thereunto perfect.</hi> But in theſe Sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of ſin, but our Saviour Chriſt the great Sacrifice perfects for ever them which are ſanctified; there cometh all the Believers perfection in at that door, and no where elſe; <hi>For it is not poſſible that the blood of Bulls and of Goats ſhould take away ſins. In Burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſacrifices for ſin thou haſt had no pleaſure.</hi> O no; for in theſe material, Ceremonial Sacrifices, there was much ſin and imperfection, and therefore God could take no pleaſure in them. <hi>And every prieſt ſtandeth dayly miniſtring, and offering oftentimes the ſame ſacrifices, which can never take away ſin.</hi> 12. <hi>But this man, after he had offered one ſacrifice for ſins, for ever ſat down on the right hand of God, from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footſtool.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that here you ſee again, That theſe Sacrifices and Offerings, before Chriſt came in the fleſh, were but for a Remembrance of Sin, and of Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the fleſh, and dying in the fleſh, and riſing again to redeem fallen loſt ſinners; <hi>For whilſt we were ſinners, Chriſt died for the ungodly.</hi> And the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lord's Supper, after Chriſt's coming in the fleſh, and dying in the fleſh, and riſing again from the dead for our juſtification, is for a Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance that Chriſt is come in the fleſh, and has ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and died in the room and place of fallen ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to expiate the guilt, and to waſh away the filth and pollution of ſin, and to atone us to God, who was the Juſt and the Holy One. <hi>He who knew no ſin, became ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God through him.</hi> Chriſt is come, and has died in the fleſh, and is juſtified in the ſpirit, by which juſtification of his, all true Believers come to be juſtified freely, and pardoned fully. <hi>Rom.</hi> 33.34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106854:13"/>demneth? It is Chriſt that died, yea, rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth interceſſion for us.</hi> This word <hi>alſo</hi> ſignifieth, that there is ſome other Interceſſor. Why look into <hi>v.</hi> 26. and there you will ſee, that the Holy Ghoſt maketh interceſſion for the Believer; and in the Believer, the ſpirit indicts all our Prayers in us, if we pray in a right manner, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. <hi>And from Jeſus Chriſt who is the faithful witneſs, and the firſt begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth:</hi> Ay, and that Antichriſt ſhall know in a little time: It draws on a-pace towards a period of his Reign. <hi>Unto him that loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood.</hi> This is the only Purgatory for ſinners, there is no Purge to be had for Sin any where elſe; and all that ever were purged and ſaved from the days of <hi>Adam,</hi> until Chriſt came in the fleſh, were ſaved upon the account of Chriſt's coming and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the fleſh, to make ſatisfaction to the Juſtice of God for their ſins, as he was their ſurety of that better Covenant, or Days-man, to fulfil all Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for them that believe.</p>
               <p>With Holy Reverence be it ſpoken, it is thus: All they that were ſaved before Chriſt came in the fleſh, and died in his eſtate of humiliation, were ſaved upon Chriſt's Word and Credit, upon the account of that Confederal Covenant that was made, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Man's Redemption, between God the Father and God the Son from all Eternity, That Chriſt in due time would come into the World, and take up humane nature, and ſtand in the room of poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and lay down his Life for poor lapſed undone Man, and to purchaſe Grace and Holineſs for us here, and Eternal Life and Salvation for us hereafter with himſelf in Glory. It is Comparatively, as if there ſhould be a Covenant made between two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for ſuch and ſuch parcels of Merchandize, or for ſuch a parcel of Land, and the purchaſer doth bargain and agree for the ſaid Merchandize or Land wholly upon Credit, and enters into Covenant or Bonds, according to their agreement, to pay him, that he purchaſed the ſaid Premiſes of, ſo much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, at ſuch a time as they do agree upon, punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; Now upon this Conſideration and Contract, he giveth the Purchaſer as ample and peaceable poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and quiet enjoyment of it, as if he had paid him every peny of the Money down upon the Nail: And he reaps all the benefit of it, until the time does come, in the which he doth actually and punctually pay him his Money according to Contract. Why, even ſo it was with a reſpect to Chriſt, in that Confederal Covenant between himſelf and God the Father, in relation to every Believer that was ſaved before Chriſt came in the fleſh, and actually laid down his life for them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19, 20. <hi>Foraſmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible things, as ſilver and gold, from your vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, received by tradition from your fathers; But with the precious blood of Chriſt, as of a lamb without blemiſh, and without ſpot: Who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifeſt in theſe laſt times for you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And ſecondly, All thoſe that ſhould be ſaved after Chriſt came in the fleſh, and actually paid the price of Redemption, by laying down his Life, by which he purchaſed all them that ever ſhould be ſaved for time then to come, to the end of the World. Now, this is like a Man that purchaſes all the Wine that ſuch a Vineyard ſhall produce for ſo long time; or like a Crop of Corn that a Man pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſeth as ſoon as the Seed is ſown, and payeth down every Farthing of his Money long before ever he receives any of the Wine or Corn: Every true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever throughout all Ages, from <hi>Adam</hi> to the end of the World, are the purchaſe of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>Take heed therefore unto your ſelves, and to all the flock, over the which the holy Ghoſt hath made you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, to feed the Church of God which he hath purchaſed with his own blood.</hi> Job 19.25. <hi>For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the earth:</hi> This was ſpoken about One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix hundred years befor ever Chriſt was born, or took fleſh upon him. Thus you ſee that Chriſt is the only Sacrifice that is ſufficient and propitiatory for the ſins of all true Believers, both under the Law and under the Goſpel; for they are all of them purchaſed at the price of his precious Blood alone: And none elſe beſide him is the Sacrifice for ſin; and his Blood is the only Purgatory for ſinners, and no other; for we are <hi>redeemed with the precious blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without blemiſh, and without ſpot.</hi>

But the Apoſtle tells us, we may eat whatſoever is ſold in the Shambles (to wit, Butchers meat) asking no queſtions for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake. And the Apoſtle did ſee by the ſame Infallible Spirit clearly and ſpontaneouſly, that a ſort of Idolatrous Gentiles, which are only nominal Chriſtians, would come into the Church or Temple of God, that would make a Sacrifice of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord's Supper, in that Scripture which I quoted before, to wit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20, 21. <hi>But I ſay, that the things which the Gentiles ſacrifice, they ſacrifice unto devils, and not unto God: and I would not that ye ſhould have fellowſhip with devils. Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of Devils; ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's Table, and of the Table of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</hi> Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> the Proteſtants do not make a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, they do not look upon the Elements of Bread and Wine to be Tranſubſtantiated into the real perſon of Chriſt, namely, of Body, Soul and Divinity, after their Bleſſing or Conſecrating of them, and ſo offer him up as a Sacrifice, as you of the <hi>Roman</hi> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity do own, and pretend to believe; and that the Elements are miraculouſly turned into the real, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Body of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Body, Soul, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and then offer him up as a Sacrifice ſufficient and propitiatory for the ſins of the living and the dead.</p>
               <p>But here will appear two Sacrifices, you will ſee by and by, in this one,—The Apoſtle ſaith, that it is a Sacrificing unto Devils, and not to God, and they that are guilty of this practice have fellowſhip with Devils in it, and not with God; for ſaith he, <hi>Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; ye cannot be partaker of the Lord's Table, and of the table of Devils.</hi> Thus you do hear what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith; it is not my word, but his, which he ſpake by Divine Inſpiration: <hi>They offer up ſacrifices unto Devils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here, I ſay, are two Sacrifices, as you may obſerve, in this one:</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, whereas the Prieſt doth pretend to offer up a Sacrifice ſufficient and propitiatory for the ſins of the living and the dead, why here the Apoſtle telleth us plainly, that this is to offer a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice unto the Devil, and not unto God: So that it is clear, that they do offer a Sacrifice unto the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, under a ſpecious pretence of ſacrificing unto God.</p>
               <p>And the ſecond Sacrifice that ſprings out of this one Sacrifice, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> The poor Lay-people do really offer up their Senſes, Reaſon, Underſtanding, and Faith, and all that ſhould be dear unto them, both as Chriſtians and Men, in Sacrifice to the Prieſt; and they are no longer Maſters of their own Senſes, Reaſon, Underſtanding, Soul and Conſcience, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

               <p>In the firſt place, if this Doctrine of yours be true, why then ſo far it renders Faith uſeleſs, and deſtroys it; for if our Saviour Chriſt be perſonally and ſubſtantially come again, and is thus preſent with his people, why then the uſe of that part o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Faith is at an end. As for inſtance, before our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt came in the fleſh, it was the duty of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>But after our Saviour Chriſt did come in the fleſh, why then that part of Faith was at an end; for after that, whoever looked for his coming in that nature, did not exerciſe Faith, but it was a great ſin, for it was the product of unbelief, which was a very great Judgment, and it is the very Grave wherein the poor ſcattered <hi>Jews</hi> have lain dead and buried ever ſince; and unbelief and prejudice againſt Chriſt, is the Grave-ſtone alſo that lyeth upon them, and keeps them down. Our Saviour told them, <hi>If ye believe not that I am he, ye ſhall die in your ſins.</hi>— But now the proper work and office of Faith is to ſee him that is inviſible, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.27. <hi>By faith he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the King, for he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured as ſeeing him who is inviſible;</hi> that was Chriſt. But how can that be? it ſeems to be a contradiction in it ſelf; what, to ſee him which cannot be ſeen! why it muſt be underſtood thus, that <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſee Chriſt by an eye of Faith, who could not be ſeen by an eye of ſence, a bodily eye. And thus <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the Faithful did ſee Chriſt before ever he came in the fleſh: <hi>Your Father Abraham rejoiced to ſee my day, and he ſaw it and was glad.</hi> And thus all true Believers do ſee and diſcern the Lord's Body at the Sacrament of the Lords-Supper; and he is to be diſcerned no otherwiſe there. And <hi>Stephen</hi> the Martyr he ſaw Chriſt in Heaven after he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.55. <hi>But he being full of the Holy Ghoſt, looked up ſtedfaſtly into Heaven, and ſaw the Glory of God, and Jeſus ſtanding on the right hand of God.</hi> But how did <hi>Stephen</hi> ſee him? why it was by an eye of faith, he being full of the Holy Ghoſt: Ay, that ſoul can never miſs of ſeeing Chriſt at any time, or in any place, that is full of the Holy Ghoſt; and <hi>Stephen</hi>'s confeſſing this, made his Enemies mad, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they run upon him and murdered him; for they perhaps thought that they could ſee as far as he could, and yet they could ſee no ſuch ſight: <hi>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. Our Saviour Chriſt can no more be ſeen now perſonally and ſubſtantially by a bodily eye of ſence, while he is at the right hand of God, than he could be ſeen in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s or <hi>Abraham</hi>'s days, which was before ever he had a ſubſtantial Body to be ſeen; neither ever ſhall he be ſo ſeen until he cometh down from Heaven in that manner as he was ſeen to go up into Heaven, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.10, 11. <hi>Nor until he appeareth the ſecond time without ſin unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.—Without ſin!</hi> why, doth not the Scripture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

All we like ſheep have gone aſtray, we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all.</hi> Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>God was manifeſted in the fleſh.</hi> Then indeed Chriſt was ſeen with bodily eyes, for he was manifeſted in the fleſh, juſtified in the ſpirit, after Chriſt had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and died, and roſe again from the dead; when he had paid the debt to God which he ſtood engaged unto him for, as a ſurety for ſinners; when the Law was fulfilled, and the Juſtice of God fully ſatisfied, and the wrath of God wholly appeaſed, then Chriſt muſt needs be juſtified, and by his being juſtified all his people for whom he died, were all juſtified. It was juſt as if a rich man were ſurety for a poor indigent man that was deeply in debt, and was not able to pay one farthing; why the Creditors take no notice of the poor Debtor, but fall upon the rich man that is his ſurety, and arreſt him, and caſt him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to priſon, upon which the rich man payeth all the poor mans debts, and then he comes forth, having fully diſcharged the debt, he and the poor Debtor are both fully diſcharged, the Priſon could hold him no longer, ſo that both the Surety and the Debtor are juſtified and acquitted, the Law cannot take hold neither of the Surety nor the Debtor again, for that is fulfilled; why even ſo comparatively it was with a reſpect to Chriſt and poor ſinners, he was bound for poor ſinners, and the Juſtice of God paſt by them, and ſeiſed upon Chriſt, and arreſted him, and caſt him into priſon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.8, 9. <hi>He was taken from priſon, and from judgment,</hi> &amp;c. Which I take to be the priſon of the Grave, for death could not hold him, but he paid every farthing of all the debt for all them for whom he died; and when he had diſcharged the debt for poor ſinners, then he himſelf was fully diſcharged and juſtified, and all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in him; and in this ſenſe every believer is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, that is, they are free from the reigning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning power of ſin, tho not from the in-being of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. And ſo is to be underſtood that 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

               <p>Secondly, If this Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> in your Churches ſenſe be true, (to wit) That the Prieſt does convert the Bread and Wine into the real perſon of Chriſt, namely of Body, Soul and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; then this muſt needs be a very great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Miracle, that muſt neceſſarily and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially follow.</p>
               <p>Therefore before we go any further, let us inquire a little into the nature and tendency of Miracles, and of their uſe and end, namely of thoſe Miracles which we do find in Holy Writ, for I am perſwaded it will be worth our while; and let us ſee if there be any kind of correſpondency, or the leaſt coherence between this Tranſubſtantiated Miracle, and them holy, true and real Miracles.</p>
               <p>And the firſt Miracle that I will begin with ſhall be that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he turned his Rod into a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; why the people that were preſent ſaw that it was a Serpent; and when his Rod ſwallowed up the Magicians Rods, which they by their Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had turned into Serpents, the people ſaw that it was ſo, and their ſenſes and reaſon was ſatisfied of the reality of the thing, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When <hi>Moſes</hi> ſmote with his Rod upon the Sea, and the Sea divided and made a way for the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to paſs through as on dry land, the people of God ſaw it, ay and the <hi>Egpptians</hi> ſaw it too, to their utter deſtruction, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.16, 17, 21, 25, 26, 27, 28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, When <hi>Moſes</hi> ſmote upon the Rock with his Rod, and the water guſhed out, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.5, 6. the people ſaw this Miracle, it was not done in Hug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-mugger, for they drank of it, and highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it for ſweet water, comparing it to Honey, in Scripture; why their ſences, and reaſon, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding was ſatisfied that it was a real Miracle, it did not deſtroy their Intellectuals, as your mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle does, nor captivate their ſences and reaſon.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A fourth miracle was that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Elijah</hi>'s raiſing the widows Son that was dead, to life again, in 1 <hi>King</hi> 17.20, 21, 22, 23, 24. the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſaw that her ſon was really dead before, and ſhe alſo ſaw that her ſon was really alive after the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had raiſed him, her ſences and reaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> of Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more in the Old Teſtament, but theſe ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice me, and I hope the Reader alſo.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſhall give you ſome Inſtances out of the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Firſt, of the Miracles which our Saviour Chriſt himſelf wrought.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, of ſome of the Miracles which the Apoſtles wrought.</p>
               <p>Firſt, of ſome of the Miracles which our Saviour Chriſt himſelf wrought when he was at the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at <hi>Cana,</hi> he turned water into Wine; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſaw that it was Water before, and they both ſaw and taſted that it was really Wine after Chriſt had wrought the Miracle; for the Governour or Steward of the Feaſt highly commended it to be far better Wine than any they had drank on before, of that which was of the real blood of the Grape, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.9, 10, 23. Here was ſence and reaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all ſatisfied of the reality of the Miracle.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſecond Miracle that I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhall be that of his Curing the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>'s Wives Mother of a Fever; and you do ſtile St. <hi>Peter</hi> Prince of the Apoſtles, yet a <hi>Married Man,</hi> Mat. 8.14, 15. <hi>And when Jeſus was come into Peter's houſe, he ſaw his wives mother laid, and ſick of a Fever, and he touched her hand, and the Fever left her, and ſhe aroſe and miniſtred unto them.</hi> The Woman felt the effects of the Miracle, and the people ſaw it, and were all ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>A third Miracle of Chriſt's, was his opening the eyes of him that was born blind; his Parents and his Neighbours knew that he was born blind, and they ſaw perfectly and clearly that his Eyes were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and that he had received his ſight, <hi>Joh</hi> 9.18, 19, 20, 21. <hi>But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been born blind, and received his ſight; and they asked them, ſaying, Is this your Son which ye ſay was born blind? how then doth he now ſee? His Parents an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them, and ſaid, We know that this is our Son, and that he was born blind; but by what means he now ſeeth, we know not, or who hath opened his Eyes, we know not, he is of age, ask him, he ſhall ſpeak for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> They knew that he was born blind; and they knew alſo that his Eyes were miraculouſly opened, and were well aſſured and ſatisfied of the reality of the thing.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A fourth Miracle was that of his rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead; his Siſters and Friends had buried him before Chriſt came, inſomuch that his Siſter concluded that he ſtunk, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.39, 41, 42, 43, 44. <hi>Jeſus ſaid, Take ye away the ſtone: Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha the Siſter of him that was dead, ſaith unto him, Lord, by this time he ſtinketh; for he hath been dead four days. Then they took away the ſtone from the place where the dead was laid, and Jeſus lift up his eyes, and ſaid, Father, I thank thee, that thou haſt heard me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:106854:16"/>the people which ſtand by, that they may believe that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> Mark ye, our Saviour Chriſt was for fatisfying the people, the ſtanders by, to convince them of the reality of the Miracle, and alſo to let them know by what power and authority he did it. And when he thus had ſpoken, he cried with a loud voice, <hi>Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead came forth hound hand and ſoot with grave-clothes, and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jeſus ſaith unto them, Looſe him, and let him go.</hi> v. 45. <hi>Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had ſeen the things which Jeſus did, believed on him.</hi> Here you ſee the people that were there, all ſaw this great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Miracle, and all their ſences that were proper to be exerciſed on that occaſion, were fully ſatisfied, and their reaſon was not ſent empty nor blindfold away, nor with a Padlock clapt upon it, as your miracle of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> always does unto them that believe it.</p>
               <p>The fifth and laſt Miracle that I ſhall now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Saviour's, ſhall be the Miracle of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which was his riſing from the dead, and his Miraculous Appearance unto his Diſciples, which is the Crowning miracle of all which he wrought, tho not the laſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.36, 37, 38, 39, 40. <hi>And as they thus ſpake, Jeſus himſelf ſlood in the midſt of them, and ſaith unto them, Peace be unto you: But they were terrifed and affrighted, and ſuppoſed that they had ſeen a ſpirit.</hi> What made them thus afraid? Why it was Chriſt's Miraculous coming into the room through the Doors, as we may ſay, and ſtood in the midſt of them, the Doors being all ſhut faſt for fear of the <hi>Jews. And he ſaid unto them, why are ye troubled, and why do thoughts ariſe in your hearts? behold my hands and my feet, that it is I my ſelf; handle me and ſee, for a ſpirit hath not fieſh and bones, as ye ſee me have. And when he had thus ſpoken, he ſhewed them his hands and his feet.</hi> Joh. 20.19, 20, 24, 25, 26. <hi>Then the ſame day at evening, being the firſt day of the week, when the Doors were ſhut where the Diſciples were aſſembled for fear of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If you of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks that are Lay-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were but as incredulous about your Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> as <hi>Thomas a Didimus</hi> was of Chriſt's Reſurrection, I know not how the Prieſts would do to ſatisfie you; but here you ſee that our Saviour Chriſt did ſatisfie all his Diſciples, for he ſatisfied their ſences and reaſon, and all the ſcruples that did ariſe in them, and he did not ſend their underſtandings empty away, nor hoodwinkt; here was ſeeing, hearing, and feeling, fully ſatisfied, and reaſon and underſtanding ſent full fraighted or laden away, and no room left for the leaſt doubt or ſcruple to be made of the truth and reality of thoſe Miracles.</p>

Now, if your Prieſts could do ſo, then it were ſomething like; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot do it, it is not only nothing, but it is that which is inſinitely worſe than nothing, it is a very dangerous, pernicious Doctrine, for it is a ſtrong Deluſion, and it is one of Antichriſt, the Man of Sin's Lying Wonders; for they that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to work this Miracle, do deſpiſe and contemn the Holy Scriptures, as you may ſee in that ſame Chapter, where Antichriſt the Man of Sin is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed: For theſe are two of his Characters, <hi>viz.</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wonders, and Diſowning the Goſpel. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Even him whoſe coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and ſigns, and lying wonders:</hi> That is, he claims all power both ſpiritual and temporal, which either his craft or his cruelty can reach, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.24, 25. <hi>And his power ſhall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he ſhall deſtroy wonderfully, and ſhall proſper and practice, and ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the mighty and the holy people.

               <p n="3">3. Thirdly and laſtly, The Apoſtles, whenever they wrought Miracles, the people ſaw that they were Miracles, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.6, 7. <hi>And the people with one accord gave good heed unto theſe things which Philip ſpake, hearing and ſeeing the Miracles which he did. For unclean ſpirits, crying with loud voices, came out of many that were poſſeſſed with them: and many taken with palſies, and that were lame, were healed.</hi> And their very enemies did ſee the Miracles which they wrought, and were forced to confeſs and own it; as you may ſee, in <hi>Acts</hi> 4.16. <hi>Saying, What ſhall we do to theſe men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done, it is manifeſt to all them that dwell in Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and we cannot deny it.</hi> And the Apoſtles did raiſe the dead alſo, and the people, both good and bad, did hear and ſee the Miracles which they wrought, and were all ſatisfied with the reality of them, or elſe it could be no Miracle. There was never any Miracle wrought that ever I read of, in the Sacred Scriptures, as I can remember, either by the Prophets who were inſpired by the Holy Choſt before Chriſt came in the fleſh, or by our Saviour Chriſt himſelf, or by any of his Apoſtles, that ever deſtroyed mens Senſes and Reaſon, and put out the very light of their Underſtanding; but the Miracles which they all wrought, brought their own clear and undeniable evidence along with them: They have, as we may ſay, ſpoken clearly and fully for themſelves, they need no tricky, nor force, nor cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning artiſices to create a belief in the people, of the real truth of them; but all the people that ſaw them, have always been ſatisfied that it was a real thing.</p>

               <p>But now this Tranſubſtantiated Miracle of yours does not, nor cannot ſatisfy any Man's Senſes or Reaſon, unleſs it be with Ignorance: I dare be bold to ſay, and appeal to all men, that no <hi>Romaniſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf can have his Senſe and Reaſon ſatisfied as to the truth of it; for it cannot be, it is impoſſible. All that can be ſaid, is this, their unbelief has over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and captivated their Senſe and Reaſon, and ſo they do lay a force upon it, and ſuſpend the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the dictates of it; as our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.12. <hi>That ſeeing, they may ſee, and not perceive; and hearing, they may hear, and not underſtand.</hi> They may force their Tongues, and ſo extort a Confeſſion, that the Bread, or Wafer in the Sacrament, is the Real Body and Subſtantial Fleſh of Chriſt; but the Eye ſaith, Tongue thou lieſt at the ſame time; for the Eye ſeeth no change upon the Accidents, but they remains ſtill as they were before; which if there were ſuch a change wrought upon them, then the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would ceaſe to be, and quite diſappear, but he ſeeth the Elements ſtill remaining as they were: But implicit Faith and Unbelief hath ſo blinded his ſpiritual Eyes, that he muſt not believe his own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Eyes; by which means be cannot, or will not perceive the deceit: And their hearts being ſo hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin, that they will not exerciſe their thoughts about it; and their hearts are ſo beclouded, or vailed over with their falſe Doctrine, that although they hear better things with their Ears, yet-they muſt not believe them, becauſe they are bound to believe as their Church commands them to believe: And the Hand that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

And as for the Wine that is really turned into blood, they muſt take the Prieſts word for that, and pawn the Salvation of their Souls for the truth of it too. But tho they do blind themſelves in this nature, yet their Senſes and Reaſon do their Office, tho they will not hearken unto them, nor give the leaſt credit unto what they inform them.</p>
               <p>And Chriſt and the Apoſtle tells them, that it is Bread after Conſecration, and that the Cup is a Cup in which the Wine is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17. And their own Senſes and Reaſon tell them that it is ſo; but they will not believe Chriſt, nor the Apoſtles, no nor their own Eyes, Noſe, Hands nor Mouth; but they will believe as the Church believes, or believe the Prieſt before them all, altho they have neither their own Senſes, Reaſon, nor Underſtanding on their ſide, nor the Holy Scriptures on their ſide, which is the revealed will of God, and ought to be the Rule for every Chriſtian to live and walk by. But, Sir, your own ſenſe, and reaſon, and underſtanding, and the Sacred Scriptures, are all againſt you, and this is the main reaſon why your Prieſts will not permit nor allow the uſe of the Goſpel-light, that holy and Sacred Touchſtone, to the people, for if they did, it would diſcover all their ſpiritual coyn to be but droſs and counterfeit, and it would never paſs among the people, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20. <hi>For every one that doth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved.</hi> They firſt put out the light of the Goſpel, and then they bring them to reſign up their ſences, and reaſon, and underſtanding, and conſcience, and ſouls and all, unto the conduct of the Prieſts or Church. And when they have them thus in the dark, why then they lead them which way they pleaſe, for he is no longer acted nor guided by his own reaſon or underſtanding, nor by the holy Scriptures, but by the Prieſts: O Sirs, look to the Word of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. <hi>To the Law and to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no light in them.</hi> O precious ſouls, do not deceive your ſelves, I beſeech you, by ſollowing theſe blind Guides, but take our bleſſed Redeemer's advice and counſel in <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.14. <hi>Let them alone,</hi> that is as much as to ſay, do not follow them, <hi>they be blind leaders of the blind, and if the blind lead the blind, both ſhall fall into the ditch.</hi> And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.16. <hi>For the leaders of this people cauſe them to err, and they that are lead of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I have told you before. Wherefore if they ſhall ſay unto you, Behold he is in the deſert, go not forth; behold, he is in the ſecret chambers, believe it not.</hi> And Antichriſt was to ariſe, and come with all Power, and Signs, and Lying Wonders, ſaith the Apoſtle, which is the ſame character which our Saviour gives of him.</p>
               <p>This deſert where theſe falſe Chriſts are, I take it to be a Church or People, profeſſing the name of Chriſt in words, but deny him in works; <hi>being abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, diſobedient, and unto every good work reprobate,</hi> Titus 1.16. They are a Company of Deſerters, that have deſerted Chriſt, and run from the true Chriſtian Colours; for you ſee they are a ſort of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Chriſtians, that do own Chriſt's Name, but they do follow another Jeſus, as I have already ſhewed from the Apoſtles words, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.4. They are a people that have deſerted Chriſt's Standard, who himſelf is Generaliſſimo of all the Chriſtian ſpiritual Soldiers, or Army.</p>
               <p>But theſe falſe Prophets and others, are thoſe that are gone over to Antichriſt, who is Head and Generaliſſimo of all the many Antichriſts and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.</p>
               <p>Now that our Saviour Chriſt propheſied here of Antichriſt's riſing, it appeareth to me to be as clear as the Sun that ſhineth in the firmament; becauſe the Apoſtle hath laid down the very ſame Character of Antichriſt, and his Diſciples and falſe Prophets, as our Saviour had done before; for our Redeemer ſaith, that <hi>there ſhould ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, which ſhould ſhew great ſigns and wonders, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that (if it were poſſible) they ſhould deceive the very elect.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>the Man of ſin, Antichriſt, ſhould come after the working of Satan, with all power, and ſigns, and lying wonders, and with all deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs in them that periſh.</hi> Our Saviour ſaith, conſequentially, Signs, and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Deceit. And the Apoſtle alſo ſaith, Signs. Wonders and Deceit. <hi>If it were paſſible
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106854:17"/>they ſhall deceive the very elect,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, that is, by their great Signs, and Lying Wonders, <hi>They ſhall come with all deceivableneſs of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in them that periſh,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. And then here followeth their deſertion of the Standard of Chriſt their General; <hi>Becauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved.</hi> Here they firſt deſert God, and then God deſerts them, as you may ſee in thoſe following words of the Apoſtle, as I have already proved: <hi>And for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lie, that they all might be damned who believe not the truth:</hi> That is, thoſe who believe not the Goſpel of God in oppoſition to this lie, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs: Surely then this muſt needs be a dreadful deſert, when a Church or people deſert and leave God,—And God doth caſt off them, and deſert and leave them; this I humbly conceive to be the meaning of our Saviour Chriſt, in <hi>Matt.</hi> 24. which does agree, and ſuit ſo well with that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s deſcription of Antichriſt the Man of Sin; this is that deſert where theſe ſwarms of falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets are and do reſide, it is a deſerted falſe worſhip. And hear again what is ſaid in 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.18, 19. with which Scripture I ſhall cloſe this Head, and ſo go on towards the finiſhing of this Diſcourſe; <hi>Little children, it is the laſt time: and as ye have heard that Antichriſt ſhall come, even now are there many Antichriſts, whereby we know that it is the laſt time.</hi> There be the falſe Prophets which Chriſt tells us ſhould ariſe, and ſhow great ſigns and wonders to deceive the credulous people. And here followeth their Apoſtatizing or Deſertion, to wit, <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: But they went out, that they might be made manifeſt that they were not all of us.</hi> Thus you ſee that this Doctrine of yours is not true; and your Tronſubſtantiated Chriſt is but a falſe Chriſt, and of the number of thoſe Chriſts that are out in the Deſart,</p>
               <p>Now, I pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> do not take it amiſs that I deal thus plainly with you; nor do not think much of my repeating over ſome things that have been mentioned under former Heads; for you know in a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al at Law among Men, you have often one and the ſame thing repeated over and over, by the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ay, and we have it ſo in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alſo in many places, and in many caſes; and I will give you one which relates unto this our Tryal, or Diſcourſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>I marvel that ye are ſo ſoon removed from him that called you into the grace of Chriſt, unto another goſpel: Which is not another; but there be ſome that trouble you, and would pervert the goſpel of Chriſt.

Secondly, The ſecond Miracle which this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine does afford us, is almoſt as great as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, namely this, that the Prieſts ſhould ever have the boldneſs to make ſuch an invaſion upon mens ſenſes, reaſon and underſtanding! and have the confidence to impoſe ſuch horrible abſurdities and rediculous nonſence upon the people, that is ſo full of contradictions in it ſelf, and made of a ſtrong deluſion, that is contrary to the Holy Scripture, and contrary to your own Creed, and contrary to Senſe and Reaſon, and contrary to the very Nature of Miracles! for altho Miracles are above Senſe and Reaſon, yet ſuch is the nature of them, that the firſt thing they do, after they are brought forth, is to ſee that mens Senſes, and Reaſon, and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding are ſatisfied with the reallity of it, or elſe it can be no Miracle: For how can a perſon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and wonder at a thing that is common, which he ſeeth no change in, nor alteration upon? Tho it is true, God's end and deſign in working of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles was infinitely higher; for it was for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation and eſtabliſhing the Churches for the Ages that were to come, and for the good of God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and for the greater aggravation of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of Chriſt's enemies. But yet ſtill the people ſaw theſe Miracles when they were wrought, and were ſatisfied with the truth and reallity of them; and many were convinced and converted by them, <hi>John</hi> 11.42, 43, 44, 45.—Now if a Man ſhould tell me, that he is flying in the Air, when I ſee him go along the ſtreet upon the ground, as I my ſelf do, why this begets no manner of wonder in me, except it ſhould be at the Man's Impudence, and for his lying, ridiculous Nonſence: But if a Man did really fly in the Air, and I ſaw him do it, that would be a Miracle, ay altho he ſhould tell me that he was then walking in the Street. Now in ſuch Caſes as theſe are, Seeing is always to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before Believing; So that this Doctrine of yours is but a meer fancy, a dream, or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as the Apoſtle phraſes it, <hi>A ſtrong deluſion, and lying wonder,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, our Saviour Chriſt called it Bread, after he had bleſſed it; and called the Wine, Cup, after he had given thanks; and the Apoſtle called it Bread and Cup after Conſecration or Bleſſing of them, when he did exhibit them unto the People, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17. <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt? the bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt?

               <p>And our Saviour Chriſt and the Apoſtles, gave both the Bread and the Wine unto all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that did partake, as well to the Lay-People, as to the Eccleſiaſticks, without any the leaſt Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in them words of our Saviour's command, <hi>Drink ye all of it;</hi> and you will hear that it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Bread, and breaking of Bread, in ſeveral places of the Sacred Scripture, Acts 2.42. <hi>And they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſtedfaſt in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</hi> 1 Cor. 10.16, 17. <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt? For we being many are one bread, and one body; for we are all partakers of that one bread,</hi> that is, Chriſt the Bread of Life. Here it is ſaid, Communion with the Blood, and with the Bread; that is thus, Believers have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with a crucified Redeemer, and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Fellowſhip one with another, in that Holy Ordinance of the Lords Supper. As you may ſee in the ſame Chapter, 20, 21. <hi>verſes,</hi> all thoſe that make a Sacrifice of the Ordinance of the Lords Supper, have fellowſhip with Devils. But in the 17 verſe, there the true Goſpel-Church is called Bread, and ſo is Chriſt her Head alſo; both the Head, and the Body, which is the Church, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Bread. And in Acts 20.7. <hi>And upon the firſt day of the week, when the Diſciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow.</hi> Thus you ſee it was called Bread, and not Fleſh, both in the firſt Inſtitution of the Ordinance by our Saviour Chriſt himſelf; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by the Apoſtles at the Celebration of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ordinance among the Diſciples.</p>
               <p>Therefore this eating of Chriſt's Body, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Blood, is to be underſtood no otherwiſe than our Saviour Chriſt intended and appointed it, which was Spiritual and Sacramental, for to commemorate his death and ſufferings, and all the bleſſed fruits and effects that do flow therefrom into the ſouls of Believers.</p>
               <p>There is a feeding upon Chriſt in every Spiritual Goſpel-Ordinance of God in Religious Worſhip and Diſcipline by Faith; the Goſpel-Ordinances are a feaſt of fat things full of marrow, of wine from the lees well refined, as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> calls it; and on them the ſouls of Believers do feed and feaſt with, and upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And this feeding upon Chriſt's Body, and drinking his Blood in the Sacrament of the Lords-Supper, as well as in all other Ordinances of the Goſpel aforeſaid, is to be done by faith, as I have already proved; for every believing ſoul doth live upon Chriſt by faith, who is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

And alſo, I ſhall draw a Parallel between the Holy Scriptures which we Proteſtants profeſs and own, and the Scriptures which Antichriſt doth profeſs and own, which is that another Goſpel which I have ſpoken unto you of, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, I do poſitively aſſert, That the Holy Scriptures which we profeſs, could not be invented and made by a Heretick, becauſe it damns Hereſy, and ſo conſequently Hereticks, to Hell and Damnation, 2 Pet. 2.1, 2. <hi>But there were falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets among the People; even as there ſhall be falſe Teachers among you, who privily ſhall bring in damnable Hereſies, denying the Lord that bought them, and bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves ſwift deſtruction. And many ſhall follow their pernicious ways, by reaſon of whom the way of truth ſhall be evil ſpoken of.</hi> Now would any Heretick write Deſtruction and Damnation, and ſuch bitter things againſt himſelf, think you? No ſure; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could not be a Heretick that made and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the Holy Scriptures. Ay, but it may be objected that he may be a Heretick, and not know it; why it is very true, a Perſon may be a Heretick and not know it; nay, I do believe that it is ſo with all Hereticks; nay, I do believe that the greateſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks in the World, do count themſelves the beſt Chriſtians; nay, the only Chriſtians, and all others Hereticks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.3, 4, 5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.9.— But yet notwithſtanding in this reſpect he could not be a Heretick, but he muſt know it; for what is Hereſy, but Error and Falſhood about Spiritual things; it is a miſ-guided Judgment; and could any Man have ſuch Gifts and Parts, as to invent the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that muſt not certainly know that what he writ at the ſame time, were lies and falſhood; and what he writ in the Name of God, and for God's Word, was but his own? It is impoſſible that ever he could be a Heretick in this Senſe, but that he muſt know it; and ſurely he would never have written ſo ſeverely againſt Hereſy and falſe Doctrine; therefore the Scriptures which we profeſs, muſt not be the Word of Man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, It could not be an Apoſtate of any ſort that writ the Holy Scriptures, or that invented them; for ſee what it ſaith of ſuch, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. <hi>For it is impoſſible for theſe who were once enlightened, and have taſted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and have taſted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come; If they ſhall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; ſeeing they crucifie to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame,</hi> Now would any kind
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106854:19"/>of Apoſtate, either from you to us, or from us to you, or to nothing at all, which is better than that which ſome People profeſs, ever write ſo ſeverely againſt his own Practice, and exclude himſelf from Heaven and Happineſs for ever? Therefore it could not be an Apoſtate that made and invented the Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, It could not be a Hypocrite that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the Scriptures which we profeſs and own, becauſe it denounceth Wo and Damnation to ſuch, Matth. 23.13, 14. <hi>Wo unto you, Scribes and Phariſees, hypocrites; for ye ſhut up the kingdom of Heaven againſt men: for ye neither go in your ſelves, neither ſuffer ye them, which are entring, to go in. Wo unto you, Scribes and Phariſees, hypocrites; for ye devour widows houſes, and for a pretence make long prayers; therefore ye ſhall receive the greater damnation.</hi> Now can it be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that ever either Heretick or Apoſtate, or Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, would write thus dreadfully againſt themſelves, when as theſe three ſorts of Men, eſpecially, in all Ages have been the greateſt Sticklers againſt, and Oppoſers of the Holy Scriptures; and alſo the moſt violent Perſecutors of them who are, or have been the ſtricteſt Profeſſors of it?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, It could not be a Coveteous and Proud Perſon, or a Griping Uſurer, that made or invented the Scriptures, becauſe it ſpeaks againſt them, as much as it does againſt them that make Images, and bow down unto them, and worſhip them, which God hath poſitively forbid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. For a covetous Perſon, the Scripture hath particularly Branded with that black-Pitch-Mark of Hell, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Idolatry, in theſe words, <hi>viz. Beware of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, which is Idolatry.</hi> And our Saviour hath told us, that it is a very difficult thing for a rich Man, who truſteth in his Riches, to get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and be ſaved. And it is ſaid, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the Proud, and beholdeth them afar off; and the Uſurer is much ſpoken againſt in the Holy Scriptures; therefore it could be neither of theſe bad Men that made or invented the Holy Scriptures, becauſe they would never have written ſo ſeverely againſt themſelves, for it is contrary to Nature.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fifthly, It could not be a Whoremonger, nor an Adulterer, for the Scripture ſaith, That <hi>Whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Adulterers God will judg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Sixthly, It could not be a Thief, or a Murderer, nor an Unrighteous Perſon, nor a Lier, nor a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicator, nor an Extortioner, nor a Reviler, nor a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring Sorcerer, nor an Effeminate Perſon, nor an Abuſer of himſelf with Mankind, neither could it be a Drunkard, or a Glutton. It could not poſſibly be any of all theſe ſorts of bad Men, that made or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the Scriptures, becauſe they would never have denounced ſuch heavy Judgments againſt themſelves for all theſe Sins which are againſt the very Light of Nature, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10.</p>
               <p n="7">7.

               <p>Pray give me leave to put a Caſe unto you. Now ſuppoſe for Argument ſake, to illuſtrate the matter, that the King's Majeſty in Concurrence with his two Houſes of Parliament, the Great Council of the Land, ſhould make a Law for ſome Reaſon of State, that it ſhould be no leſs than High Treaſon for any of his Subjects to make his Image, or to have his Picture, or the Likeneſs of any thing that doth belong to him, in Imitation of it; and Iſſue out his Proclamation, ſtraightly and ſtrictly forbidding all his Subjects attempting the doing it, upon Pain of the inevitable eſcaping the ſevereſt Puniſhment, which properly belongeth unto thoſe that are Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of High Treaſon. But yet, notwithſtanding this ſevere Prohibition of the King, there ſhould be ſome Perſons would be ſo daring and bold, as to preſume to do it out of a pretended, but blind Zeal of Loyalty; and not reſt ſatisfied in, nor with their own Treaſon and Rebellion, but they would force others of his Subjects to do ſo likewiſe, or elſe they would knock them in the head, or burn them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were truly Loyal, and kept to the Kings Laws in this Caſe made and provided.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Secondly, In the ſecond place, neither could it be good Men that made and invented the Scriptures of their own Brain. Firſt, It could not be them which count themſelves Good: Nor, Secondly, Could it be them whom God by his Grace hath made Good.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt it could not be a Moral Honeſt Good Man, that made and invented the Scriptures, who counts himſelf ſo; for he will tell you, That he ſhall go to Heaven, and be ſaved, becauſe he deals uprightly and juſtly with all men, and payeth every one their own, and does wrong to no man, and I do as I would be done by; which is all very good in its place; and let me tell you, that it is ſo good, that there is no going to Heaven without it; but yet let me tell thee alſo, Tho thou doſt give Man his due, yet if thou doſt not give God his due, it will all avail thee nothing in Point of Juſtification and Salvation: But what is it to give God his due? Why the ſole Conduct and Government of thy Soul, all thou art, and all thou haſt, muſt be reſigned up to God from whence thou didſt receive it; thou muſt forſake all, whenever God in his Providence calls thee to it, and deny thy ſelf, and follow Chriſt the Lamb of God whitherſoever he goeth. Will you ſee a full Scripture for proof of this? Why you ſhall, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.18, 19, 20, 21. <hi>Jeſus ſaid, Thou ſhalt do no murder; thou ſhalt not commit Adultery; thou ſhalt not ſteal; thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs; honour thy father and thy mother; and, thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf. The young man ſaith unto him, All theſe things have I kept from my youth up; What lack I yet? Jeſus ſaid unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and ſell that thou haſt, and give to the poor, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in Heaven, and come and follow me.</hi> Moral Honeſty will not do, unleſs we follow Chriſt by Faith, and in Love. Therefore it could not be a Moral Honeſt Man that made or invented the Scriptures, becauſe they are quite againſt him; and ſurely if the Moral Good Man had made them, he would have made his way wide enough for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to go to Heaven, and be ſaved by his Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, There is another ſort of Perſons that count themſelves ſo good, that they think there is none like them, but that they are the only good men in the world, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.9.—And theſe are a whipping ſort of Good Men, the <hi>Phariſaical</hi> ſelf-righteous Men, that are ſo zealous in their way to make up a Righteouſneſs of their own, to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſaved by, that they will whip themſelves; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

Pray hear what our Saviour Chriſt ſaith of theſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Two men went up into the Temple to pray, the one a Phariſee, and the other a Publican. The Phariſee ſtood and prayed thus with himſelf, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are.</hi>—Our Saviour Chriſt has told us, that Publicans and Harlots ſhall go to Heaven before a ſelf-righteous Man ſhall. And in <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.12, 13. <hi>There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet are not waſhed from their filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eye-lids are lifted up.</hi> Thus you ſee that it could not be a Self-righteous Man which counts himſelf a good Man, that made and invented the Scripture; that makes up a righteouſneſs of his own, part of works of Mercy, and part of works of Cruelty; who are for Meritorious works, and works of Supererogation; that think to climb up to Heaven by that Rope of Sand; for if ſuch a Man had made the Scriptures, he would never have written ſuch bitter things againſt himſelf, and left himſelf in the hopeleſſeſt condition of all ſorts of men in the whole World, of ever being ſaved, without a change of that principle.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But Thirdly and Laſtly, Might it not be a good Man that had the Grace of God in his heart, and the fear of God before his eyes, that might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and compoſe the Scriptures? To this I anſwer in the negative; No, it is impoſſible that it could be: Tho, it is true, there is nothing in the Holy Scriptures that is againſt him for his goodneſs, as there is nothing in them that doth indulge a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man in his wickedneſs. And therefore you will ſay, that a good Man was the likelieſt of all men to have made and invented the Scriptures. But yet notwithſtanding give me leave to tell ye, that a good Man could not, nor dare not invent the holy Scriptures, for it is utterly inconſiſtent with his goodneſs; for can he be a good Man, and yet at the ſame time be a deceitful Man? For he would be the inventer of an evil thing, if it were invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Man, for it would be a Lie; becauſe inſtead of being the Word of God, it would be the word of Man: But you ſee this cannot poſſibly be; for it would be to do evil, that good might come of it, which the Scriptures does down-rightly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, If neither bad men, nor good men made and invented the Scriptures, Then pray, who were they made and invented by?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, the Word of God telleth us all plainly in theſe following Scriptures, who it was that made the Holy Scriptures, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20, 21. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this firſt, that no propheſie is of any private interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> man:</hi> that is, Man did not invent them; <hi>but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16. <hi>All ſcripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs.</hi> Rev. 1.1. <hi>The Revelations of Jeſus Chriſt, which God gave unto him, to ſhew unto his ſervants things which muſt ſhortly come to paſs; and he ſent and ſignified it by his Angel unto his ſervant John.</hi> And in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1, 2. <hi>God who at ſundry times, and in divers manners, ſpake in time paſt unto the fathers, by the prophets, Hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken to us by his ſon, whom he hath appointed heir of all things; by whom he alſo made the worlds.</hi> John 1.14. <hi>And the word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the father, full of grace and truth.</hi> Chriſt is the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Word of God, and all godly men have the Spirit of Chriſt dwelling and abiding in them; and that is the reaſon that good men in all Ages have put ſuch a value upon the Holy Scriptures, and would ſuffer any thing, rather than part with the Holy Scriptures: <hi>David</hi> prized them above his appointed food; and the Martyrs prized them above their Lives, which made them go joyfully to Priſons, to the Gibbet, to the Flames; and this made them rejoyce at the place of Execution, and clap their hands in the Flames, which ſtruck terror to their Adverſaries. And what made them do this? Why, next unto the holy Ghoſt, it was becauſe they knew that the Holy Scriptures were true, and that their Redeemer that was revealed in them, ever liveth, and did make ſatisfaction and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to God the Father for them: Ay, and he was with them and in them at the Gibbet, and in the very Flames, as he was with the three Worthies of old, in the fiery Furnace, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.25. <hi>He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and ſaid, Lo, I ſee four men looſe, walking in the midſt of the fire, and they have no hurt, and the form of the fourth is like the ſon of God.</hi> I hope by this time, you are not only perſuaded, that the Scriptures that we Proteſtants do profeſs and own, were not the invention of Man; but alſo you are ſatisfied of the veracity, or truth of them, That they are not invented by men of any ſort, but are indeed, and in truth, the Holy Word of God.</p>
               <p>But leſt you ſhould be yet ſtaggering or ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, for further corroboration, I will add Eight Arguments, and I will draw a parallel between our Scripture, which we Proteſtants do profeſs and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be the Word of God, and the Scriptures of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, my firſt Argument ſhall be this, If the Holy Bible does not give the leaſt indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or countenance to any kind of Sin and Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity whatſoever, then the Scriptures muſt be the revealed Will and Word of God: But the Holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:106854:21"/>we Proteſtants of all ſorts, do own and believe to be the Word of God, does not give the leaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence or Countenance unto any kind of Sin or Iniquity: Therefore the Holy Scriptures muſt be the Word of God, and not the Invention of men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If the Scriptures were not made by bad men, nor invented by Good men, then it muſt be infallibly the word of the true and living God. But you ſee clearly proved that the Scriptures were not made by bad men, nor invented by good men; therefore they muſt be the Word of the living and true God, and made by him without the help of man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, If the Scriptures do not in the leaſt degree, diſcourage and diſcountenance Grace and Holineſs, but is the promoter of it; then the Scriptures muſt be the Holy Word of God. But the Scriptures do not in the leaſt degree diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage or diſcountenance Grace and Holineſs, but do promote it in the hearts of Believers; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Holy Scriptures muſt be the infallible Word of God, not the word of Man, nor of Mans making or inventing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, If the Scriptures teach all Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Virtue, Moral and Divine, both for Body and Soul, and Detect and Condemn all manner of Evil, which is hurtful to Body and Soul, both temporal and ſpiritual Evils, and gives righteous Rules to Men to walk by, and ſhews them what is Good, and how they ſhould demean themſelves in every Relation, Station and Condition, from the Prince upon the Throne, unto him that grindeth at the Mill; and teacheth the Prince how to Rule and Govern in Righteouſneſs and Peace; and teacheth the People how to be governed in the fear of the Lord, and to obey them that have the Rule over them, not for Wrath, but for Conſcience-ſake, and all for the Good and Weal both of Prince and People. Then, ſurely the Scriptures muſt be the Word of God, and not the Word of Men. But the Holy Scriptures which we Proteſtants do own and believe to be the word of God, do teach all Goodneſs and Virtue, Moral and Divine, both for Body and Soul, and Detect and Condemn all manner of Evil, which is hurtful to Body and Soul, both temporal and ſpiritual Evils, and gives righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Rules to Men to live and walk by, and ſhews them what is Good, and how they ſhould demean themſelves in every Relation, Station and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the Prince upon the Throne, unto him that grindeth at the Mill; and teacheth the Prince how to Rule and Govern in Righteouſneſs and Peace: and teacheth the People how to be governed in the fear of the Lord, and to obey them which have the Rule over them, not for Wrath, but for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience-ſake, and all for the Good and Weal, both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> which we Proteſtants of all ſorts do profeſs and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, muſt be the Word of God, and not the Word of Men, nor of Mens Invention.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fifthly, If the Scriptures had been invented by any ſort of ſinful men whatſoever, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that ſinful man would have made proviſion for the fleſh, and given Indulgence to his own ſin and luſts; for it is natural for every one to be kind to themſelves, and to cheriſh that which they love.</p>
               <p>But the Holy Scriptures do no not give the leaſt Indulgence or Countenance unto any one particular Sin or Immorality in the whole Book of God, from the firſt of <hi>Geneſis</hi> unto the laſt of <hi>Revelations;</hi> but the whole Current of the Scriptures is bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Scriptures were not the Invention of man, but muſt be the Word of God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Sixthly, If the Scriptures in all Ages have been the Object of wicked and ungodly mens rage and malice, which have cauſed them to perſecute thoſe perſons to the very Death, that have been the ſtricteſt Profeſſors of it, then it could not be wicked men that made and invented the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>But the Holy Scriptures in all Ages have been the Object of wicked and ungodly mens Rage and Malice, which have cauſed them to perſecute thoſe perſons to the very Death, that have been the ſtricteſt Profeſſors of it.</p>
               <p>Therefore it could not be wicked and ungodly men that made or invented the Holy Scriptures; But it muſt be the Word of God.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Seventhly, If wicked men had made and invented the Scriptures, Satan having the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Conduct of them, and they being acted and influenced and led by his Spirit, as a Good man is acted and influenced, and led by the Holy Ghoſt; for Satan ruleth in the Hearts of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Diſobedience; for he is their Father, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. <hi>Ye are of your father the Devil, and the luſts of your father ye will do; he was a murderer from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and abode not in the truth; when he ſpeaketh a lye, he ſpeaketh of his own; for he is a lyar, and the father of it.</hi> Now, I ſay, if the Children of the Devil had made the Scriptures, they would have been tender and favourable unto their Father's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Intereſt, and have given ſome Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance unto it, and not have made the whole bent and ſtream of the Scriptures againſt it, and afford no manner of Indulgence to themſelves, who are the Devil's Subjects or Vaſſals, or rather his Bond-ſlaves indeed, nor no manner of Relief or Support to his Kingdom; But are made againſt all Hereſie and all other Iniquity, which is that wherein the ſtrength of the Devil's Kingdom lieth; then ſurely the Holy Scriptures muſt be the Word of God, and not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

               <p>Eighthly and Laſtly, If it be not in the Power of a Good Man to give the Reward that cometh by Grace, of Eternal Life and Salvation, which is the full Fruition and Enjoyment of God for ever in Glory, which is promiſed in Scripture unto all them who believe and obey it; Nor to execute the threatnings of Hell and Damnation, by puniſhing all thoſe with eternal torment which the Holy Scriptures have denounced againſt all them that tranſgreſs by their diſobedience unto it, becauſe it would be to promiſe that which he was no way in the leaſt meaſure or degree capable to perform or make good, and threaten that which he hath not a power to execute.</p>
               <p>Then it could not be a good man that made or invented the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>But it is not in the power of a good man to give the reward that cometh by Grace of Eternal Life and Salvation, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. which is the full fruition and enjoyment of God for ever in Gloty, which is promiſed in Scripture unto all them who believe and obey it, nor to execute the threatnings of Hell and Damnation, by puniſhing all thoſe with eternal torment, which the Holy Scriptures hath denounced againſt all them that tranſgreſs, by their diſobedience unto it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17, 18. Becauſe it would be to promiſe that which he knew in his own Conſcience that he was no way in the leaſt meaſure or degree capable to perform or make good, and to threaten to inflict that puniſhment which was not in his power to execute; and ſo he would have been a liar and an impoſtor, which is quite contrary to the Principle of a good man, and it is utterly inconſiſtent with his Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>Therefore it could not be a good man that made or invented the Sacred Scriptures, becauſe this power is peculiar and wholly in the hands of God, and therefore it muſt be the word of God. The Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>But I certifie you, brethren, that the Goſpel which was preached by me, is not after man, for I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee clearly proved, That the Holy Scriptures were not made nor invented by either good men or bad men. Therefore it muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the Infallible Word of the True and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-living God, and not a humane Invention.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall cloſe up this Diſcourſe in drawing a Parallel between ſome part of the Holy Scriptures of Chriſt, and the Scriptures of Antichriſt, which is that <hi>another Goſpel,</hi> as the Apoſtle called it in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.4. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 18.9. And I ſhall Anſwer another Objection with Three Arguments, and ſo finiſh the whole.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt the Goſpel of Chriſt teacheth Love Peace, Meekneſs, Humility, and lowlineſs of mind, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.15. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24, 25.</p>

               <p>But the Goſpel of Antichriſt teacheth men to do evil for good; for if they know that a man doth but endeavour to convince them of their Errors and Hereſie, which is the greateſt and beſt good that any man can do for a Perſon, they will Burn or Hang him, or clap him up in the Inquiſition for a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, if it lieth in their Power, which is to do the greateſt evil for the greateſt good.</p>

               <p>Tenthly, The Goſpel of Chriſt teacheth men to confeſs their ſins to God, and to one another, and to pray one for another unto God, and beg of him to pardon us in the Blood of Chriſt, and that God would give the Grace of Faith and unfeigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto us, that we may hate ſin, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all our ſins; and here you may ſee what true Repentance is in all the parts of it, laid down by the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10, 11. <hi>For godly ſorrow worketh repentance to ſalvation, not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of; but the ſorrow of the world worketh death. For behold, this ſelf-ſame thing that ye ſorrowed after a godly ſort, what carefulneſs it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of your ſelves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement deſire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge; in all things ye have appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved your ſelves to be clear in this matter.</hi> This is true Goſpel Repentance in all the parts of it; this is Repentance unto Salvation, never to be repented of; they are careful to uſe the uttermoſt power that God hath given them in the means of Grace, never to commit ſin more; and they clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by confeſſing their ſins to God, and forſaking of them; and they take up a holy indignation, and an implacable hatred againſt ſin, and ſtudy how to be revenged upon it, as a Man doth upon his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable enemy; and he hath a vehement deſire after Grace and Holineſs, and uſeth all the means of Grace which God hath appointed to that end: And by their being hearty and ſincere in the work, they can approve themſelves to God in this matter, or appeal to God, through Jeſus Chriſt, from their Conſciences, that they are truly penitent, and have the evidence of it in themſelves. And it is ſaid, <hi>if we confeſs our ſins,</hi> that is, after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner aforeſaid, not a bare verbal Confeſſion, that <hi>God is juſt to forgive us our ſins.</hi>

               <p>Now you cannot Pray one among another, nor Pray one for another in a right manner, but you muſt confeſs your Sins to God, and to one another; for if you confeſs your Sins, and do not pray; or if you do pray, and not confeſs your Sins, it is neither a right Goſpel-Confeſſion, nor a right Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.

               <p>But this is juſt like unto a poor Man that is deeply in Debt to the King for Tribute, and he meets with another Man that is deeper in Debt to the King than he, and the latter ſaith unto the other, <hi>Sir,</hi> I ſuppoſe you are in the King's Debt. Yes, <hi>Sir,</hi> I am. Well, do but Confeſs to me, how much your Debt is, and give me a ſmall Fee, and I will pardon you; ſo he confeſſeth, and he Pardons him as he pretends. But the poor Man ſtands ſtill charged in the King's Books, and then he runs on again further in Debt; and he goes to his old Friend, and confeſſes his Debt, and he Pardons him the King's Debt, but he will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him his own Fees; <hi>no Penny, no Pater-Noſter;</hi> no, that is a Debt cannot be forgiven, and ſo he goes on in Debt again and again, and he pardons him; but all this while, he hath none of the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for ſo doing. But at laſt, the King calls both theſe Debtors to Account; he, that pretended to forgive the other his Debt to the King, who himſelf was deeper in Debt to the King, than the other that he pardoned; and the pardoned man, he pleads that he is pardoned; who pardoned you? Why, ſuch a one; What had he to do to Pardon you that, which you do owe unto me? He never had any ſuch Power from me, for he had more need of a Pardon for himſelf; did he not owe me enough himſelf, but muſt he take your Debt upon him too? Then the King in a great Fury, cauſes them both to be Seiſed, and clapt up into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and never to come out, until they have paid the utmoſt Farthing. So will it be with all them which pretend to Pardon other Mens Sins, and with them alſo that rely upon their Pardon, living and dying in that Condition; it is of no more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue than for one Thief or Highway-man to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don another of their bloody Crimes; none can pardon Sin, but God. Good Men may Judg that ſuch and ſuch Men are pardoned upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; or a Church may pronounce in their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fure, ſuch a one pardoned, but none but God can Pardon them, Mark 2.7, 10. <hi>Why doth this man thus ſpeak Blaſphemies?

               <p> But the Goſpel of Antichriſt teacheth Men to rely upon their own Righteouſneſs and Works of Merit; Ay, tho Works of Miſchief and Darkneſs, ſome of them, and to expect to be ſaved by that, in Conjunction with the Righteouſneſs and Merits of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Fifteenthly and Laſtly, To name no more, the Goſpel of God teacheth us to do Juſtice, and to love Mercy, and to walk Humbly with the Lord our God, Mic. 6.8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good: and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Goſpel of Antichriſt teacheth men to do Injuſtice, and to love and delight in Cruelty and Perſecution, and to walk loftily, and to carry it proudly towards God and Mun.</p>
               <p>Thus I have ſhewed you in part, what a vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is between the Goſpel of Chriſt, which is that which we Proteſtants do own and believe to be the revealed Will and Word of God, and ought to be the only Rule for all People to Live and Walk by, and eſpecially to Worſhip God by; and the Goſpel of Antichriſt; there is as much difference, as there is between Light and Darkneſs; for indeed, it is even ſo, for the Goſpel of Chriſt is the great Light in the World, it is the Light of Heaven, above all other Light in the World; the Light of the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> is but Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs compared with this Light of the Goſpel of God, for it is the Light which comes from Heaven. And the Goſpel of Antichriſt is the greateſt Darkneſs in the World, it ſprings from the utter Darkneſs of Hell; all other Darkneſs is Light compared to that.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall finiſh this Diſcourſe with three Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
               <p>But it may be that ſome Perſons will ſay, They do own the Scriptures, tho they do not own ſome Doctrines which we that are Proteſtants do own, whom they count Hereticks; and perhaps they may ſay, That I have acknowledged it in the firſt Part of my Book, that they do own the Scriptures; why yes, that is true, they do own it after a ſort; they do by the Holy Scriptures, as Clippers and Coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners do do by the Kings lawful Standard Money; they take the largeſt, faireſt Money, and Clip, and File it away, and cover over Copper, and Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit the Kings Stamp, and ſhuffle it away for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Coyn, among them that cannot diſcern it to be ſo. Why, even ſo they do by the King of Kings Coyn, the Holy and Sacred Scriptures; they add and diminiſh as their ſeeming Intereſt lieth. But here is what will be their Portion, unleſs they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>the words of the Prophecy of this book, If any man ſhall add unto theſe things, God ſhall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book. And if any man ſhall take away from the words of the book of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, God ſhall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy City, and from the things which are written in this book.</hi> Deut. 4.2. Prov. 30.6.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Now, my firſt finſhing Argument is this, If any Perſons deny the Satisfaction made to the Law and Juſtice of God, by the Righteouſneſs and Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, to be wholly and intirely ſufficient of it ſelf, to juſtifie and acquit a Sinner of all his guilt of Sin before God, then theſe Perſons, tho they pretend to own part of the Scriptures, yet they do deny the whole Scriptures, both of the Old and New Teſtament, becauſe it is the Fundamental Doctrine of Mans Salvation in both Teſtaments, Jam. 2.10. <hi>For whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</hi> As partial Obedience, is no Obedience; ſo partial owning the Scripture, is a denying the Scripture in Fundamentals, which is to deny the whole Scripture. But there are a ſort of Perſons that profeſs themſelves to be Chriſtians, that do deny the Satisfaction made to the Law and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, by the Righteouſneſs and Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, to be wholly and intirely ſufficient of it ſelf, to juſtifie and acquit a Sinner of all his guilt of Sin before God. Therefore theſe Perſons, tho they pretend to be Chriſtians, and own ſome part of the Scriptures, yet theſe very Perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Eſſential Being of true Chriſtianity, and deny the whole Scriptures, both of Old and New Teſtament, becauſe there is this Fundamental Doctrine of Mans Salvation in both Teſtaments, and a partial owning of Fundamental Doctrines of the Holy Scriptures, is a total denial of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, if any ſort of perſons, who call themſelves Chriſtians, under the diſpenſation of the Goſpel, do ſet up, allow, and maintain the Order of Prieſthood, Material Altars, and alſo Material Sacrifices, then thoſe ſort of Chriſtian do deny that that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, and ſo they deny the whole Goſpel of God, and are turned back to the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law; therefore no ſuch perſon or perſons that are of this Principle, can, or ought to be Judges and Interpreters of the Holy Scriptures. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16. <hi>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him: neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned. But he that is ſpiritual judgeth all things, yet he himſelf is judged of no man. For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:106854:23"/>Chriſt.</hi> There is no more reaſon for ſuch a Man that is of Antichriſtian Principles, not except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Antichriſt himſelf, to be Judge of the Holy Scriptures, than there is for a Thief or a Murderer to be his own Judge.</p>
               <p>But there are a ſort of perſons which call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians now, under the diſpenſation of the Goſpel. that do ſet up, allow, and maintain the Order of Prieſthood, material Altars, and alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Sacrifices; therefore theſe ſort of Chriſtians do deny that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, and ſo they deny the whole Goſpel of God, and are turned back to the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Ceremonial Law, and are not competent Judges, nor Infallible Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Holy Scriptures; but he that is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual judgeth all things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly and laſtly, If any pretended Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Principle, does teach men and women to be worſe than their natural diſpoſitions, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt inclinations, then that Religion, or Principle, muſt be both falſe and dangerous to themſelves and others, and is of the Devil: But the pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Principles of Antichriſt, doth teach men and women to be worſe than their natural diſpoſitions and corrupt inclinations; therefore that Religion, or Principle, muſt be both falſe and dangerous unto themſelves and others; and Satan is the founder of that Opinion and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
               <p>It may be that you will ſay, that our Scriptures are not rightly tranſlated, and eſpecially that paſſage of <hi>Job</hi>'s Wife, where it is ſaid, that ſhe ſaid, <hi>Curſe God, and die;</hi> I will not ſay that every Iota of it is rightly Tranſlated; but yet this I will ſay, That all the fundamental Doctrines of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, which contain matter of Eternal Life and Salvation, by the Righteouſneſs and Merits of Jeſus Chriſt alone, are rightly Tranſlated; and every true Believer that hath the Grace of God in him, can ſet to his Seal, and bear witneſs unto the Truth of it. There may be ſome things that are not rightly Tranſlated, that do not contain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Salvation in them; as for inſtance, in that of <hi>Job</hi>'s Wife, it is no matter of Salvation to know certainly whether ſhe ſaid, <hi>Curſe God and die,</hi> or <hi>Bleſs God and die;</hi> for as ſhe might ſpeak it, it might be much at one, as many of the Learned do underſtand it; no doubt but that ſhe ſpoke it Ironically, and ſo conſequently Atheiſtically, or elſe <hi>Job</hi> would not have replied, <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt as one of the fooliſh women ſpeaketh;</hi> for if ſhe ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
